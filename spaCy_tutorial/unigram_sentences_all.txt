-PRON- love and miss -PRON- mother -PRON- will always be with -PRON- in -PRON- heart
Dear Smith family If someone would ask -PRON- who -PRON- admire most in life Gene Smith would be at the top of the list
a true rag to riches story
From struggle farmer to aerospace engineer
From live in a run down farm house with no running water to a home with a swimming pool
-PRON- be so full of wonderful memory about Gene and Barb
-PRON- be so thankful that -PRON- have be part of -PRON- life
the story Gene would tell about Uncle Boyd and Aunt Virginia live out on the farm be priceless
Gene relay that during World War II sugar be ration
Boyd decide to bury -PRON- sugar to hide -PRON- from the authority regretfully -PRON- forget where -PRON- bury -PRON-
This bury treasure become an urban legend and somehow the sugar be morph to money
-PRON- know where Gene get -PRON- sense of humor and adventure from -PRON- father Boyd
Boyd be a real character
-PRON- wife Virginia be the most kind good humor and easy go person on earth -PRON- have to be to off set -PRON- risk take husband
apparently when Gene be a young teenager and just learn to fly -PRON- dad be in the hospital and simply check -PRON- out
-PRON- call Gene and tell -PRON- to get in the airplane and come get -PRON-
when the young inexperienced pilot land in Cedar Rapids there be Boyd at the end of the runway wait for -PRON-
other story Gene tell about Boyd ’s adventure with the airplane involve several crash
accord to Gene one accident result in Boyd be scalp and Virginia break several bone
-PRON- guess -PRON- could call Boyd one lucky aviator
-PRON- recently run into a man at the Brooklyn nursing home Bob Murtha who be a pilot in WWII -PRON- ask -PRON- why -PRON- do not have an airplane
-PRON- giggle and respond
-PRON- uncle wreck -PRON-
Gene ’s nickname be
Guts
-PRON- do not back down from a fight
and -PRON- be willing to take a risk
-PRON- be home in Victor over Christmas and join Dad ’s coffee crew
one of Gene ’s friend Don Branyon be there and tell the story of how Gene and -PRON- good friend in high school would get into argument while -PRON- be in the car
Gene would pull over the two would get out settle -PRON- difference with a fist fight and get back the car like nothing have happen
This happen many many time and accord to Don Gene would win the verbal argument but fall short with the fist
-PRON- remember go to Los Angeles as a child and go with the Smith kid to Knott ’s Berry Farm and Disneyland
-PRON- especially remember one New Year ’s Day when -PRON- attempt to attend the Rose Bowl Parade
the problem be that -PRON- be so foggy -PRON- could not see
Gene be drive through fog with Uncle Chuck walk in front of the car guide -PRON- through the bad
a car with a boat attach to -PRON- roof run a light crash into the car in front and the boat go sail down the street
Once -PRON- finally arrive at the parade -PRON- be so crowded that -PRON- could not see a thing
Gene be the good story teller -PRON- have ever encounter
Gene and Dad Don be raise more like brother than first cousin
the good Thanksgivings -PRON- ever experience be those when Gene Barb Mom and Dad would come to celebrate
-PRON- would stand mesmerize at -PRON- island in the kitchen as Gene would entertain -PRON- with story of Boyd Virginia and adventure with Dad
Gene and Dad ’s
shenanigan go way back
one time when Gene be in detention at school and be force to write

-PRON- will not fill in the blank 100 time on the blackboard
-PRON- Dad climb up to the second story cling to the side of the building -PRON- inch -PRON- way to the classroom crawl in the window and help Gene finish -PRON- punishment
the plan be foil when the teacher walk in and see Dad ’s shoe stick out from under -PRON- desk
another Don and Gene adventure that stick out involve a shatter windshield
Dad Gene and Lowell Jack be on -PRON- way to a music festival in Williamsburg in Grandpa Raymond ’s 1937 Chevy
For some stupid reason Gene bring along Uncle Boyd ’s loaded pistol
Lowell think -PRON- be a toy gun grab the gun and point -PRON- at Gene ’s head
Gene knock -PRON- away just in time the gun go off and shatter the windshield
-PRON- drive the car to a dealership in nearby Marengo for repair where the owner realize there be something fishy go on and call -PRON- parent
the three teenager make up a plausible excuse practice -PRON- and convince -PRON- parent that -PRON- be simply a rock that shatter the windshield
the Smith Rohrer Nixon Thanksgivings could not be complete without a trip downtown DC to the Air and Space Museum
Gene would show -PRON- the Minute Man Missile and explain how -PRON- be involve in -PRON- creation and why -PRON- be replace
even today when -PRON- be in the museum -PRON- go pay homage to Gene and -PRON- minute man missile
Dad and Gene be child of the great depression could not pass up a deal and could not stand throw away something that have any life leave in -PRON-
This philosophy regretfully match perfectly with -PRON- husband Brian
While Barb Mom and -PRON- be off have fun at a craft fair -PRON- give -PRON- husband the chore of go to the dump with strict order Do not come back with more that -PRON- take
Dad Gene and Brian come back snicker and brag that -PRON- have discover the art of dumpster diving

-PRON- also could not throw anything away while the three be present
-PRON- be constantly pull thing -PRON- to the trash question why -PRON- would throw this away
At one point -PRON- be try to make room in the refrigerator for leave over Thanksgiving dinner and throw some old grape away
several minute later -PRON- spot Dad and Gene hover over the waste basket pull grape out of the trash and eat -PRON- and lament why -PRON- would throw this away
These memory that -PRON- have of Gene and those -PRON- share with -PRON- be precious -PRON- be sorry -PRON- can not tell -PRON- as well as the master story- teller -PRON-
-PRON- be truly one of a kind and as Jeff say -PRON- cross the finish line
-PRON- like to think of -PRON- as race across the finish line fist pump up in the air yell
what a ride

TIME
MACHINE a portrait of Rod Smith March 23 1998 during the project
Stags Leap Portrait of a Community in which Rod serve as writer in residence
and -PRON- serve as poet in residence
the restaurant Terra be unmemorable as in the sense of immemorial
Since time immemorial -PRON- have be there perch in the left hand of the city of the christian saint Helena and as long as -PRON- sit -PRON- sense of time vanishe utterly
watch melt off the wrist of the wait staff
-PRON- have even go to the sly extreme of make the antiquity of the wall look like a contemporary effect like faux faux as if this be a casual and recent establishment
but do not let -PRON- fool -PRON-
Dinner here will evolve into conversation which provide intersection at which -PRON- can linger deep into the night with the Jupiter probe and the memory of -PRON- first love affair
-PRON- own thought and idea will arrive like so many dish skillfully tailor and -PRON- will unabashedly share that indelicate greed of the moment of cinnamon and the raw flesh of fish tenderly bed down over lettuce
and across the table in this meal which last -PRON- whole lifetime sit Rod Smith dress in -PRON- black italian suit relax -PRON- vigilance alert the menu to -PRON- presence and -PRON- every appetite and what a meal become when Rod wield the wine list be something -PRON- will whisper to -PRON- grandchild
rod -PRON- will tell -PRON- -PRON- be the priest of wine for surely there be such a priesthood for those who take vow of sensuality and apply careful thought like a spritz of lemon to the smoke rise off the grill
and as -PRON- lift the glass to -PRON- lip -PRON- feel a sensation in -PRON- own gullet and realize that this be the Vicarious Supper Club and in the medium of wine -PRON- can learn more by watch than -PRON- ever could again by taste
and so -PRON- sit in a bouquet of time fragrant with grape harvest long past and by the time dessert arrive chaperone by port and a distillation of coffee bean -PRON- have no need ever again to be afraid of -PRON- hunger
Rod be with Dana when -PRON- know -PRON-
when -PRON- first meet -PRON- -PRON- be blow away that wine could mean so many thing but when -PRON- probe -PRON- to try and describe the taste -PRON- start to understand -PRON- detail and truthful imagination in the description
As -PRON- be transition in career -PRON- move in with -PRON- then boyfriend and Rod come to -PRON- home to help -PRON- pack -PRON- box
when -PRON- get to Mark 's the boyfriend place -PRON- must have look quite pale and unprepared for this step and -PRON- see that
-PRON- pull -PRON- aside and say -PRON- could move -PRON- out as easily as -PRON- could move -PRON- in
-PRON- be reassure handsome and unique
-PRON- love -PRON- through Dana and -PRON- new find love for wine and all -PRON- could be
sadness fill -PRON- heart for -PRON- family -PRON- child and for have a torment that possess -PRON- and lead -PRON- to leave -PRON- all
rod and -PRON- meet in college and spend some time together in San Francisco in the late 70
-PRON- writing career be just a dream at that point
and -PRON- be happy to discover
when -PRON- reconnecte some 30 year later that -PRON- achieve some great measure of success be marry and have two wonderful kid
and now this a death far too young and far too soon
-PRON- be sorry -PRON- never reconnecte in person in recent year but be grateful -PRON- be in touch

Smith continue to write for the magazine regularly until 2006 when -PRON- leave active wine write to focus on raise a family with -PRON- wife Catherine Bartolomei and raise pinot noir vine on -PRON- ranch in Forestville
during -PRON- year as a wine writer Smith ’s distinctive voice and the concision of -PRON- prose allow -PRON- to express an emotional connection to wine and the place where -PRON- grow
-PRON- essay be base on extensive research rigorous argument and the kind of discipline use of language that make the concept of terroir accessible to a wide audience
On a personal note Rod remain a close friend for many year
In 1999 -PRON- work together on a project that introduce -PRON- to the far coast of Sonoma a region -PRON- already know well
-PRON- visit the develop vineyard at Flowers and Hirsch Rod write the text -PRON- take the photo

during those research trip -PRON- would often stop at Hog Island Oyster Farm and pick up dozen of oyster ice -PRON- down for the drive to San Francisco ’s California Street where Rod live with -PRON- first wife the artist Dana DeKalb
Dana would make duck fat fry while -PRON- shuck the oyster and -PRON- would down -PRON- all with Pierre Peters Champagne
later after Rod remarry and settle at the Bartolomei Ranch -PRON- become interested in plant the hillside behind the house and take on the vineyard project while -PRON- wife Catherine run the Farmhouse Inn

a memorial service for Rod Smith be hold on May 9 at St. Paul ’s Episcopal Church in Healdsburg
wine and travel maven know Rod Smith for -PRON- revelatory magazine writing which sift history landscape and viticulture into something fresh and new
-PRON- know -PRON- as a friend and a kind of hero start in -PRON- first year of college
only slightly old in year Rod be supremely advanced in swagger
As a virginal freshman spring from a tribe of the befuddled and fearful -PRON- fly like a moth to Rod ’s adventurous flame
-PRON- glow shed not just courage but enlightenment
-PRON- guide Rod and -PRON- to psychedelic encounter with spirit god in the desert
-PRON- illuminate the Raymond Chandler and Herman Melville passage -PRON- read aloud in Rod ’s Southern California shack listen to weird music and talk about the writer -PRON- would be
set this down now in -PRON- 60 -PRON- wince at a certain portentous tone
but how else to convey Rod ’s power to make life epic
the enemy be numb american complacency the air condition nightmare in Henry Miller ’s word
Rod ’s way out be to drink $ 50 wine in -PRON- dusty shack
no one could leap high and low like Rodric Mar Smith
greasy chow fun in an ancient curtain Chinatown booth for lunch dinner at French Laundry
Rod revere America an un air condition throwback America populate by the gambler rum runner train hopper and cowboy in Grateful Dead song
-PRON- be at a Dead concert by the way where Rod save -PRON- ass
there -PRON- be by the Winterland stage nineteen seventy something sway to a symphonic Terrapin when the soundwave and crowd heat among other thing short circuit -PRON- head
when -PRON- come to on the floor Rod have elbow out breathing space from the writhe crowd and be fan -PRON- with -PRON- shirt
-PRON- feel safe
safe under Rod ’s wing
As year unfold and -PRON- move up to the Northwest -PRON- still buy ticket to the Dead when -PRON- be nearby Rod follow -PRON- across America and get in backstage
whatever scene -PRON- be
Rod do -PRON- big and bold
-PRON- do a little boating around Puget Sound Rod sail the Pacific
-PRON- cover crime and business for a newspaper Rod roam the world reinvent wine writing and never punch a clock
what do Rod even see in a klutz like -PRON-
Anything beyond -PRON- devoted reflection
and yet there -PRON- be the most dapper wedding guest toast -PRON- bride before -PRON- later nurse -PRON- wounded heart after -PRON- untimely death
there -PRON- still be meet up to retrace battle trench in France and Jack London ’s footstep in California
These of course be Rod ’s passion
-PRON- steer the boat
Truth be tell always be epic get tiresome maybe even tyrannical
rod once pronounce in all seriousness that -PRON- could never live in an American League city because of -PRON- insipid designate Hitter rule -PRON- live in an American League city
and so around the turn of the millennium -PRON- come to see that
if -PRON- ever be to to find -PRON- own way -PRON- need more distance from Rod ’s blind flame
-PRON- be not anything that be announce
neither of -PRON- ¬— preoccupy with new wife home and gig necessarily intend to let -PRON- foundational friendship fade
-PRON- just do
-PRON- have not see Rod in almost 20 year when -PRON- hear that -PRON- have die
how many time have -PRON- think about try to reconnect
to thank -PRON- for all -PRON- have teach -PRON- for the bravado that -PRON- have lend to -PRON- meager store
and to explain that -PRON- be not his fault
-PRON- have pick the part of Robin to -PRON- Batman until -PRON- could not play -PRON- anymore
that be on -PRON-
-PRON- do not know that the door be close
another lesson from Rod do not wait around for shit

As -PRON- write in August 2017 Sandy be a wonderful college classmate who leave -PRON- much too soon
As a waiter dishwasher in -PRON- sorority house for three year -PRON- see -PRON- often and recall -PRON- well
-PRON- will add another Rocky Bay story
-PRON- do not want to snitch on the source
uhh
yes
-PRON- do
-PRON- be Ann and Ruth
-PRON- all be have dinner in the village and
at some point Sandy go to the lady room
only when -PRON- be go do
Ann and Ruth tell -PRON- the tale of Sandy 's reaction to another faux pas by the Kelley family
seem to be a habit with -PRON-
-PRON- uproot and take out quite a few tree down by the shore presumably because of -PRON- condition
i'm not sure -PRON- reason
be vaguely responsible folk -PRON- doubt -PRON- intent be to annoy anybody least of all Sandy
well when Sandy arrive and see the relatively empty space where the tree have be locate Ann and Ruth say -PRON- go down to the area and count how many have be take down each one needlessly in -PRON- opinion
mom and sis say -PRON- could hear -PRON- counting as -PRON- examine the ground count unhappily for sure
-PRON- gather that this be not a one time activity for Sandy
-PRON- apparently go down several time do the counting thing several time each time get a high number become more upset after each visit
This story lead to a few laugh at the table for both Ruth and Ann and -PRON-
absolutely all of those laugh occur when Sandy be absent from the table and upon -PRON- return the topic of conversation abruptly change
no mention of tree or -PRON- absence due to Mom and sis be aware that -PRON- mention may spoil the entrée and the occasion for San

-PRON- have be think about -PRON- this week dear friend as -PRON- birthday draw near
-PRON- be remember -PRON- visit to Columbia City when -PRON- travel for PBS
visit with -PRON- one on one be always the good way to learn what be go on in -PRON- life
As fresman roommate in the Morgue at Hanover and then sorority sister in ADPi -PRON- share good time and challenging time
the prank and good laugh be the good
-PRON- be so glad -PRON- keep communicate through the year and -PRON- think about -PRON- pledge class reunion at the cabin so often
-PRON- be a great pie baking entertain hostess
-PRON- make Monkey Puke for everyone
Sandy be a true friend to -PRON- and so many other that -PRON- encounter
-PRON- be easy to see that -PRON- be genuine care funny and thoughtful
-PRON- keep in touch via email until not that long ago and -PRON- miss hear from -PRON-
Sandy be -PRON- Big Sister in -PRON- college sorority 50 year ago and after graduation be -PRON- roommate in Denver for two year
-PRON- always get along well though -PRON- be often the recipient of -PRON- prank
-PRON- do have an impish streak
Sandy be down to earth and honest
-PRON- do not seek attention or try to flatter or dissemble
-PRON- have keep -PRON- friendship over the year
and -PRON- be so sad that -PRON- be stricken at such an early age by the devastation of Alzheimer 's

As -PRON- wrap up a 13 year teaching stint at Colorado Mesa University -PRON- attribute what -PRON- know and teach about event management professionalism detail and follow through to Sandy and the colleague whom Sandy and -PRON- refer affectionately to as the Lou
-PRON- share a love of dog the mountain and the Adirondacks
whatever Sandy approached-
-PRON- do with precision and speed
This include drive

-PRON- will miss Sandy but generation of student teacher and television professional will continue to benefit from -PRON- work and -PRON- pizazz
thank -PRON- Sandy
-PRON- know that Sandy have a deep and abide love for Rocky Bay camp in the Adirondacks all -PRON- life
-PRON- recall when the current owner
the Kelley Family instal stair from the dock to the cabin in an effort to give a boost to any visitor of a certain age
certainly the original path be rocky and a bit twisty and may reasonably lead to a tumble or two
-PRON- intent be honorable
but
-PRON- hear from Ann and Ruth that Sandy be kind of offend by this new fangle entrance and be determined to keep to the olde tyme way of go up the hill
so -PRON- purposefully and nobly avoid the stair for a while and go up to the cabin in a circuitous route which be even rocky and risky than the original path
-PRON- choice
-PRON- suspect would have draw cheer from a variety of olde time Rocky Bay camp soul include -PRON- Dad Gret and Baba
here be to all of the story tell meal share hike with dog sunrise and sunset in Fairplay over the last 25 + year

-PRON- can not seem to come up with the right word to express how -PRON- feel except to say how terribly sad -PRON- be to lose a friend and a contemporary at an age which be far too soon to be take
-PRON- thought go out to -PRON- Ann
-PRON- love -PRON-

-PRON- wife Michele and -PRON- have the pleasure of meet Mr. Johnson on 7 December 2012 during a tribute to World War II veteran sponsor by the Sun City Grand Armed Forces Support Group where -PRON- be the guest speaker
-PRON- be immediately interested in hear -PRON- of experience as a japanese POW
-PRON- uncle Michael Peraino be a Bataan Death March survivor but never speak of the war
-PRON- be hope to get some insight of -PRON- experience and perhaps learn if -PRON- know -PRON- uncle
-PRON- be only able to speak with -PRON- briefly as there be a very large crowd at the event
that evening -PRON- present Mr. Johnson with a stain glass step stone in remembrance of the Baby of Bataan and a note express -PRON- thank for -PRON- service and share -PRON- story
the next morning -PRON- call thank -PRON- for the step stone and ask if -PRON- could visit with -PRON-
naturally -PRON- say yes
-PRON- arrive shortly afterwards and spend several hour visit with -PRON-
-PRON- then present -PRON- with a sign copy of -PRON- book something -PRON- will cherish forever
-PRON- be the beginning of a friendship that last until -PRON- passing
-PRON- visit each other quite frequently share a meal story and each other ’s company
perhaps -PRON- be old fashion but after 5 year -PRON- still call -PRON- Mr. Johnson
-PRON- be mention by almost everyone that Mr. Johnson could be very open however -PRON- also have a private side
there be time -PRON- would call and if -PRON- do not feel like talk -PRON- simply would not answer the phone
Although -PRON- respect -PRON- privacy in this matter -PRON- give way to the few time -PRON- call -PRON- Joe
-PRON- be -PRON- way to get -PRON- attention and let -PRON- know -PRON- be concerned about -PRON-
one time -PRON- call without a response only to learn a pilot friend of -PRON- fly -PRON- to White Sands New Mexico to visit the Bataan Memorial near there
thus when -PRON- initially be unable to contact -PRON- one day in June
-PRON- simply figure -PRON- be not home or do not want to talk at that time
a while later Michele insist -PRON- try call -PRON- again
This time -PRON- leave a message say if -PRON- do not call back within 5 minute -PRON- would call the sheriff ’s department
In the past this approach work well but not this time
-PRON- then drive to -PRON- home and do not receive a response at the door
-PRON- then call the sheriff ’s department who gain entry to the house and find Mr. Johnson decease
-PRON- be completely devastate
-PRON- be such a great friend who will always be remember fondly for -PRON- wit gracious smile and dear fellowship
As -PRON- husband previously mention -PRON- meet Mr. Johnson on 7 December 2012 during a tribute to World War II
Since then -PRON- have visit -PRON- home many time and -PRON- have become good friend
-PRON- always provide an interesting view on -PRON- experience and history
-PRON- share many meal and -PRON- always have a way to let -PRON- know what -PRON- would like for a future meal and naturally pecan pie for desert
pecan pie be -PRON- favorite and not to be confuse with pizza pie

-PRON- tell -PRON- as a pow the main talk be always about food
naturally be from the South -PRON- crave fry chicken and always wonder what the Yankees be talk about whenever -PRON- mention pizza pie

-PRON- be completely confused when -PRON- describe a pizza
In fact -PRON- say -PRON- have -PRON- first pizza when -PRON- be station in California
thus -PRON- make sure -PRON- always have pecan pie or pecan ice cream for dessert
-PRON- be 91 year old in January 2017 and still sharp as a tack
once while visit -PRON- -PRON- learn -PRON- be from France
-PRON- tell -PRON- -PRON- 6th grade music teacher be from France and -PRON- teach the class the french national anthem La Marseillaise in English
Mr. Johnson immediately sing the entire anthem without miss a word or note
As -PRON- tell -PRON- several time -PRON- mind be both a blessing and a curse
-PRON- have very similar background
-PRON- both grow up poor and -PRON- be able to relate to each other ’s situation such as go to bed hungry do daily chore
-PRON- believe read -PRON- book Baby of Bataan would be an inspiration to all Americans especially the youth of -PRON- country
read -PRON- and -PRON- will have a great appreciation of those who serve -PRON- country during that difficult time
As Richard -PRON- too could not bring -PRON- to call -PRON- by -PRON- first name
-PRON- european upbringing simply teach -PRON- to respect -PRON- elder
-PRON- will always think of -PRON- fondly and remember the wonderful time -PRON- share together even the time -PRON- do not feel like answer -PRON- question or agree with -PRON- comment
-PRON- would simply give -PRON- that infectious smile and act as though -PRON- do not hear -PRON- and quickly change the subject
Met Joe via Tom Zmugg and boy be -PRON- glad
-PRON- have -PRON- over for dinner a number of time that prove to be so entertaining enlightening educational enjoyable
-PRON- wish everyone could have know -PRON-
the world be a well place because of -PRON- and -PRON- lose can not be replace
May -PRON- rest In Peace

Abraham Lincoln
-PRON- beloved Uncle Joe pass away last month on -PRON- birthday and since then -PRON- have be struggle to find an appropriate way to honor and celebrate -PRON- memory and life
-PRON- know that -PRON- word could never do justice to -PRON- memory and -PRON- life so all -PRON- can do be share -PRON- own memory of the man -PRON- come to love respect and admire

-PRON- be not the year in -PRON- life that count but the life in -PRON- year
-PRON- can not think of any word that good describe Joseph Q. Johnson 's life than these word
From an early age and even into adulthood -PRON- relationship with -PRON- go far beyond just be blood relate
Over the year -PRON- have hear many people describe someone as large than life and this phrase fit -PRON- Uncle Joe both figuratively and literally
even though -PRON- do not play a major role in -PRON- upbringing Uncle Joe teach -PRON- many thing
thing that have in many way shape -PRON- into the person -PRON- be today
the jury be still out on whether or not that s a good thing but that be a story for another time
love of country family mexican food golf movie baseball the importance of a sense of humor be just a few
While grow up in Memphis -PRON- look forward to many thing
holiday Birthdays family gathering hit the link go to the movie etc

but the thing -PRON- look forward to the most be when Uncle Joe come to town
For -PRON- -PRON- be every holiday and special occasion roll into one
-PRON- always have a big smile on -PRON- face and -PRON- always treat -PRON- and -PRON- sibling as if -PRON- be -PRON- own kid
-PRON- be always captivate by -PRON- story joke and -PRON- infectious laugh
back then -PRON- do not even know the meaning of sarcasm and cynicism but Uncle Joe be a master
-PRON- be never cruel with -PRON- sarcasm but -PRON- always recognize bullshit when -PRON- see -PRON-
and -PRON- do not matter who -PRON- be
If anyone and -PRON- do mean anyone spewed bullshit Uncle Joe would call -PRON- out with a twinkle in -PRON- eye and tongue firmly implant in cheek
Uncle Joe always make -PRON- laugh even when -PRON- be the butt of one of -PRON- joke
and believe -PRON- there be many
put simply Uncle Joe be -PRON- hero
sure -PRON- put -PRON- high up on a pedestal and nothing would please -PRON- more if -PRON- make -PRON- smile or laugh at one of -PRON- joke
-PRON- could listen to -PRON- talk and tell -PRON- story for hour
grow up one of the thing that always strike -PRON- as curious be that whenever Uncle Joe come to town -PRON- Mother would always tell -PRON- not to ask -PRON- about -PRON- experience in the war
-PRON- reasoning for this be that -PRON- would get upset and angry
-PRON- do not like to revisit the horror -PRON- experience
be young and naive -PRON- do what be ask because -PRON- certainly do not want Uncle Joe to be mad at -PRON-
the irony of this be
that year later -PRON- pass this information to -PRON- and -PRON- response be classic Uncle Joe
With a roll of the eye and a big guffaw -PRON- retort -PRON- Mother be full of shit
-PRON- do not mind talk about -PRON- experience at all

-PRON- bring this up because grow up -PRON- really be not aware of the hardship -PRON- experience
-PRON- know that -PRON- serve during World War II and that -PRON- be a pow and that be pretty much -PRON-
As a dumb naive kid -PRON- just know how much -PRON- love and respect -PRON-
-PRON- look forward to -PRON- visit much like a kid look forward to Christmas
As the year go by -PRON- learn more and more about -PRON- life from -PRON- interaction and conversation with -PRON- and those close to -PRON-
-PRON- never really understand the extent of the cruelty and brutality -PRON- endure until 2004 when -PRON- publish -PRON- memoir Baby of Bataan
one example of -PRON- character be that prior to the publication of -PRON- memoir -PRON- receive an email from -PRON- want idea for the title of -PRON- book
-PRON- answer be of course Baby of Bataan and -PRON- response be typical Uncle Joe
-PRON- say that the general consensus be that -PRON- be the perfect title for -PRON- book but in truth -PRON- know many young man that serve in Bataan that deserve that title just as much as -PRON- do
In the forward to -PRON- memoir retire Colonel Karl Lowe say -PRON- best

Joe 's character -PRON- unsung duty and bravery under fire and -PRON- ability to endure the cruelty brutality and savagery of -PRON- captor be -PRON- test of true grit
that -PRON- emerge with -PRON- mind and dignity intact be the essence of what -PRON- find in Joe and -PRON- generation

In closing -PRON- have always be a humbling experience for -PRON- whenever -PRON- think about the thing -PRON- experience and endure from the age of 14 19
Acne scrap knee broken bone curfew homework awkward first kiss ROTC school boy crush to name just a few
and then -PRON- think back to what Uncle Joe go through at that age
and -PRON- be remind that what -PRON- go through be nothing in comparison
In -PRON- life -PRON- have always try to honor Uncle Joe and -PRON- memory
-PRON- name -PRON- first bear son after -PRON-
-PRON- talk about -PRON- to anyone who would listen
-PRON- think about -PRON- every time -PRON- play a round of golf
every time -PRON- hear a good joke -PRON- think Uncle Joe would have like that joke

-PRON- wish -PRON- could have witness -PRON- reaction when candidate Donald Trump say POW 's be not hero 's
-PRON- like guy that do not get capture
even though -PRON- have now go to the clearing at the end of the path -PRON- spirit and memory will live on in all of the lucky one who know and love -PRON-
-PRON- will never be forget
John R. Buddy
Graig
Joe Johnson be a humble thoughtful compassionate man
-PRON- try very hard to contact family of pow that -PRON- know who do not return home and provide closure for -PRON-
In one of the conversation -PRON- have with Joe
-PRON- ask -PRON- if Judy and -PRON- ever travel to Maine to look for a town call Hinckley and see if -PRON- could find someone that know the Hinckley family
James Hinckley be a fellow pow and -PRON- want to provide closure for the family
On one of -PRON- RV trip to the NE -PRON- wound up in Booth Bay ME for about a week
While there -PRON- decide to take a drive and see if -PRON- could find Hinckley ME
After locate -PRON- on a map -PRON- start drive
-PRON- pass a Hinckley town limit sign and stop at the first convenience store -PRON- come to
the clerk there do not know anyone in the Hinckley family but tell -PRON- that if -PRON- come in from the east on the route -PRON- be on
-PRON- pass a school found by the Hinckley family
the librarian there be more or less the town historian and -PRON- may be able to help -PRON-
back at the library the lady there research all of -PRON- information on the Hinckley family and could not find anything on a James Hinckley
-PRON- say -PRON- be possible that one of the wayfaring student at the school may have use the Hinckley name to enlist
-PRON- tell -PRON- that there be a memorial at the top of the hill on the school ground that list all of the Hinckley family that die in all war and that the visitor ’s center at the bottom of the hill may have some additional information
the memorial only list one wwii POW a Norman Hinckley
the visitor ’s center be able to find a picture of Norman still no James in uniform while -PRON- be home before leave for the Pacific
-PRON- give -PRON- a copy of the picture and accompany caption
when Joe receive the picture -PRON- exclaim
that ’s the man
wonder why -PRON- call -PRON- James
anyway from the information accompany the picture Joe be able to locate a sister live in WV and provide closure
Joe ’s nephew
Steve set up this webpage as a memorial to Joe
accordingly -PRON- will be add post from time to time to help everyone get to know Joe better
This post be about the publishing and sale of Joe ’s book Baby of Bataan
first an introduction to some people who play a part in this
Ace Godshall
a retire Marine MasterSGT friend of -PRON-
Dr. Robert Wood
a former Marine author of a book title
Good By Viet Nam and owner of the publishing company OMONOMONY
Gene Adee
a retired military pilot O-6 Navy or AF associate of an organization Voices take Flight that recognize citizen who have make major contribution to -PRON- society and one of the organizer of the annual Memorial Day Ride to the Wall
shortly after -PRON- wife Judy
and -PRON- start Rving -PRON- be back in Memphis
-PRON- be have a conversation with Ace Godshall about some thing -PRON- feel be miss for Rvers
-PRON- be difficult to find a place to get an oil change and to find a place where -PRON- could get -PRON- rv wash
-PRON- tell -PRON- about a friend that may be interested in hear -PRON- idea and perhaps finance -PRON-
Ace set up a luncheon where -PRON- introduce -PRON- to Dr Wood
-PRON- ask -PRON- how -PRON- happen to know Ace
-PRON- tell -PRON- that Ace save -PRON- life in Viet Nam not once but twice
Ace be a crew chief and door gunner on a Marine helicopter and air lift Dr. Wood out of danger twice
immediately -PRON- respect for Ace jump up a couple of notch
now on to Joe ’s book
when Joe finish -PRON- book -PRON- start look for a publisher
In the world of writer if -PRON- be an unknown no big publishing company have time for -PRON-
If -PRON- find an unknown publisher to publish -PRON- book nobody buy book from unknown publisher
Judy and -PRON- contact many of -PRON- friend look for idea to help Joe find a publisher
By now -PRON- be in the Memphis area again in -PRON- RV travel and in another conversation with Ace
-PRON- tell -PRON- about Joe and -PRON- problem find a publisher
Ace tell -PRON- that Dr. Wood have write a book since -PRON- meet -PRON- and have start -PRON- own publishing company because -PRON- could not find a publisher
After contact Dr. Wood and Joe -PRON- leave thing up to -PRON-
Dr. Wood arrange for Joe to come to Memphi s Ace pick -PRON- up at the airport because by -PRON-
Judy and
-PRON- be on the road again in -PRON- RV
Joe ’s book be publish in 2004
now the problem be get -PRON- sell
-PRON- carry a couple of case of Joe ’s book that -PRON- sell to friend along the RV trail
and -PRON- build a website for -PRON-
not much help there
aside from -PRON- publisher the individual who do the most to help Joe with book sale be Gene Adee
gene nominate Joe for the annual award present by the association
Voices take Flight
Joe be select as -PRON- honoree for that year and the ceremony be widely publicize in the Phoenix area but not so much nationwide
the next thing Gene do be arrange for Joe to travel with -PRON- motorcycle group in -PRON- annual ride to the wall
This ride start from Ontario CA and there be so many rider -PRON- have to split into a northern and southern route
Joe and Gene be to be on the southern route
On the Memorial Day weekend the group have come together just outside of DC after pick up rider along the way and begin -PRON- final ride to the Viet Nam Wall
the ride be then Rolling thunder
Gene have set thing up so that there would be tv and radio station along the way do interview with Joe
Joe ’s wife Marilyn do not want Joe to leave -PRON- and must have be scar to death of be alone
so -PRON- check -PRON- into the hospital the day Joe be suppose to leave
so -PRON- do not make the ride
there be no doubt in -PRON- mind that what Gene have set in motion for Joe would have get -PRON- national recognition which -PRON- richly deserve and push -PRON- book sale over the million mark
In the end Joe ’s book sale be down to a few that -PRON- sell at the many function where -PRON- be ask to be -PRON- guest speaker
If -PRON- read -PRON- book or be in attendance at one of the many event -PRON- speak at -PRON- know a little about Joe
not much unless -PRON- ask though
-PRON- waa a very private person
when WWII end and Joe finally get home after convalesce in Manila
-PRON- later reenliste in the Army Air Corps
In 1947 -PRON- wind up in the Air Force when the Air Corps become a separate branch of the military
-PRON- finish this enlistment and be back home play baseball with the home town team
Joe be a very good athelete and be the star of the game when -PRON- beat the USMC Reserve team who have never lose a game
the Marines immediately approach Joe and coax -PRON- into join -PRON- unit
-PRON- tell -PRON- -PRON- never go anywheere or do much and -PRON- want -PRON- on -PRON- ball team
so Joe join the Marine Reserves and a month later -PRON- unit be send to Korea where -PRON- be be shoot at once again
-PRON- eventually retire from the Marines
Carl Barber
Judy Barber Joe be -PRON- very good friend like family to -PRON-
when -PRON- meet Joe in the early 70 -PRON- become friend and play golf together all around northern California
-PRON- do not find out about -PRON- be a pow until later

two year later -PRON- meet -PRON- in Memphis for -PRON- mother 's funeral
-PRON- do not see -PRON- again until 1999 when -PRON- stop in Phoenix in -PRON- RV
Joe and -PRON- play golf while the girl 's shop
later -PRON- sit in Joe 's living room and -PRON- wife Judy ask if -PRON- have write any more magazine article about -PRON- time as a pow
Joe start quote one story after another and at that point Judy challenge -PRON- to write a book because -PRON- story be history that people need to know
-PRON- write the book Baby of Bataan
get -PRON- publish be another chapter for later
Carl Barber

-PRON- be so sorry to hear of -PRON- passing
-PRON- wish -PRON- all peace in spite of what must be a terrible loss
-PRON- first meet Rev. Johnson back in the early eighty
-PRON- become one of -PRON- student in -PRON- first confirmation class
through the year -PRON- and -PRON- family become treasured friend to -PRON- family
-PRON- always seem to have a good understanding for people and be always able to make connection no matter who -PRON- be
-PRON- be -PRON- teacher

-PRON- be a man of the people -PRON- be an incredible minister and -PRON- know -PRON- will be miss
-PRON- grandfather pass away several week ago now but every time -PRON- try to write this
-PRON- write -PRON- as if -PRON- ’s a letter -PRON- be will send -PRON-
however -PRON- can not receive these kind of letter anymore and that simple fact be hard to understand
Grandpa Johnson be without a doubt one of the most important people in -PRON- life and have truly shape -PRON- into the person -PRON- be today
-PRON- be a man of God and dedicate -PRON- life to not only -PRON- family but all those who surround -PRON-
This be not just show during -PRON- time in education or as a reverend
This be demonstrate in -PRON- every day life
-PRON- remember go to the grocery store late one night with -PRON- grandma and grandpa -PRON- be kind of in a rush
so -PRON- be an in and out kind of deal
-PRON- grandpa spot this young man stack orange and decide -PRON- be the perfect person to strike up a conversation with
-PRON- sit there for 20 minute big travel delay learn about this kid ’s life and aspiration then at the end -PRON- give -PRON- some of -PRON- invaluable advice and parted way
This be a common interaction for -PRON- grandpa and some of -PRON- read this may have experience -PRON- -PRON-
-PRON- be continuously try to teach -PRON- new thing from self defense Karate on the staircase landing to perspective art technique at the high top table

-PRON- teach -PRON- basic skill for home renovation and put -PRON- to the test on -PRON- own home
most importantly -PRON- grandpa care deeply about -PRON- moral and spiritual development
-PRON- would sit for hour discuss what -PRON- believe in and how -PRON- think thing should be and -PRON- would never push -PRON- opinion on -PRON-
-PRON- would offer -PRON- guidance but never to hinder -PRON- own path of self growth
day before -PRON- head off to report to Beast Barracks at the United States Military Academy -PRON- grandpa sit -PRON- down to talk about faith
This time in a much different respect than before
-PRON- want to make sure -PRON- believe in something

or while -PRON- be at the hospital in Portland ME because that be -PRON- last conversation before -PRON- unexpectedly pass away
-PRON- will always miss -PRON-
-PRON- loss be heaven 's gain

the doctor tell -PRON- that -PRON- tell -PRON- what be go on with u and that -PRON- have to send -PRON- to another hospital because -PRON- do not have the thing here to help -PRON-
-PRON- be so sorry that -PRON- do not get to -PRON- in time and that -PRON- have to die alone without -PRON-
but i want to tell -PRON- that -PRON- try so hard to get there before -PRON- leave -PRON- here alone
that -PRON- sit there in -PRON- hospital room lay next to hold -PRON- and cry for -PRON- to come back so -PRON- can say -PRON- be so sorry and -PRON- love -PRON- and that -PRON- be so sorry that i have to leave -PRON- alone there and that i know dad never come and that
what hurt -PRON- the most because -PRON- have to die alone and scared

-PRON- bring Noah to -PRON- home for an afternoon visit in February 2014 and -PRON- have hot chocolate and apple slice
-PRON- know strange combination but -PRON- remember that
-PRON- think -PRON- be the last time -PRON- see -PRON- as -PRON- be just in town for a short period of time since -PRON- have move to AZ
there be never a lull in conversation when Paul be around
-PRON- be sure -PRON- have make many new friend in -PRON- new home with -PRON- heavenly father

After collect group at church Paul and -PRON- always chat about -PRON- week and what -PRON- learn from the group night -PRON- would sometimes chat for two hour on a curb outside a Starbucks
one of the good thing -PRON- remember about Paul be that when -PRON- be really sick for about three month in a row and -PRON- be have difficult time withy job -PRON- would always leave -PRON- a message on Facebook or call -PRON- to see how -PRON- be feel
This leave a lasting impression on -PRON- because -PRON- even though -PRON- be very sick -PRON- care about how -PRON- feel FIRST

From the time -PRON- would knock on -PRON- office window to see if -PRON- could startle -PRON- and -PRON- do to the time that -PRON- call -PRON- an old lady driver because -PRON- be drive behind -PRON- leave the Club then -PRON- start race -PRON- never fail to brighten -PRON- day each and every time -PRON- see -PRON-

Ciao Amore come mi
dicevi sempre tu
★
è tutta la mattina che cerco di sedermi e scriverti ma una parte di -PRON- non vuole farlo
Questa parte di -PRON- è così arrabbiata che preferisce quasi fare finta di nulla
Sedermi qua a scriverti ora è
un po come ammettere di aver accettato che
non ci sei che è già passato un anno e
questo no non lo voglio accettare
Ma d’altra parte ho una tremenda voglia di parlarti
e questo è l’unico mezzo che ho e in cui mi sento ascoltata
quindi eccomi qua
una anno c’è già tutto
questo
tempo che ci divide
Un anno dall’ultima volta che ti
ho
visto un anno dall’ultima volta che ti ho parlato ascoltato abbracciato
se c’è una cosa di cui ringrazio -PRON- stessa è quella di essermi costretta a venire da te
quei primo di marzo di un anno fa
ciò mi ha dato l’opportunità di poterti stringere la mano di poterti accompagnare
di porti abbracciare
Ho potuto ascoltare per l’ultima
volta quel tuo ciao amore che mi hai sempre detto con tanta dolcezza
Ho potuto scorgere in un tuo
piccolo gesto fatto a fatica tutto l’amore che ci hai sempre donato
Ho potuto ammirare la tua incredibile forza la tua gioia e la tua pazzia anche quando le forze
ti abbandonavano
non -PRON- lo sarei mai perdonata se non avessi avuto
la forza di accompagnarti nella fine
perché è lì che più mi hai insegnato la vita e l’amore
e per questo ti ringrazio
Mi hai insegnato cosa vuol dire vivere
cosa vuol dire combattere quanto importante sia affrontare ogni
singolo giorno col sorriso e con la gioia che avevi tu e soprattutto mi hai insegnato che l’amore supera qualsiasi cosa anche la vita terrena
Sei la mamma più coraggiosa ed incredibile che conosca
Mi manchi sempre

i ✿ love -PRON- tanto tanto tanto
tua sempre Sofi ❤
ho tanta voglia di tenerti tra le mie braccia come quando erii con noi
passa il tempo ma diventa sempre piu duro amore di mamma
As time go by -PRON- seem -PRON- be the kind of person who live on in -PRON- life forever although the pain never go the joy of remember -PRON- infectious love for life family and friend make -PRON- smile on a daily basis when -PRON- think of -PRON-
forever miss forever love especially the super dessert that always make -PRON- run faster
Auguri di compleanno su con gli
angeli e duro quaggiu non vedo l'ora di vederti
Tanti auguri angelo celeste
sempre nel cuore
Auguri Rosie pensando a te oggi domani e sempre nel cuore sarrai
13 settimane sono passate da che sei
andata.domani sono gia 3 mesi la verita e tu sai come mi
potro mai sentire
io.certo
no ce molto cambio rimane sempre
la scusa di oggi vieni da noi e stai qua con noi .mi rendo conto che
sei con
noi.anche se io ho tanta voglio di abbracciarti anche solo per un instante
Tesoro lo faccio sempre attraverso Isabella io ti vedo in lei due gocce
ti mando carezze e baci
a presto
quanto mi manchi
ci sono giorni che nemmeno -PRON- ne rendo conto
aspetto tue notizie quelle notifiche su facebook che eri solita lasciarmi
o la chiamata del giorno
poi mi accorgo
di non poter più avere tutto ciò
così inizio a ricordarti a cercarti nelle foto
nelle cose vecchie che mi hai scritto è l'unico modo che ho per sentirti vicina a -PRON-
quanto darei per un tuo abbraccio
e una tua parola ora
MI MANCHI sempre
troppo
Lo so che ci sei Amore
Ti sento costantemente
ma che voglia avrei di vederti e riabbracciarti
Carissima la mia vita e un immenso vuoto.vivi per vivere tutti cercano di
consolarmi
ma nessuno
mi capishe
Ogni giorno Che passa sempre piu peasante .non
so dove sarei senza il tuo angelo.sicuramente lontano
da dove
sono adesso .vorrei
essere
la vicino per chiederti tante cose avere tante risposte
MI MANCHI SEPRE PIU XXX
ieri siamo stati tutti noi con il tuo angelo non crede assolutamente che sei volata via con
-PRON- palloncini
.io
so che
tu non smetterai mai di protergela da lassu
e noi no smetteremo mai di tenerti dappertutto in casa tu sei la sua mamma e
le manchi tanto.ti ama MAMMA
In momenti come questi non riesco a credere che
tu non ci sia
Non mi sembra normale aspetto il momento in cui riceverò
una tua chiamata vedrò una tua notifica leggerò una tua mail
Io lo
so che ci sei ieri c'eri oggi anche
ci sarai domani Ti fai sempre sentire oggi eri in
-PRON- be yours lt;3

La morte non è niente io sono solo andato nella stanza accanto
Io sono io voi siete voi
Ciò che ero per voi lo sono sempre
Datemi il nome che mi avete sempre dato parlatemi come mi avete sempre parlato non usate mai in tono diverso
non abbiate un aria solenne o triste continuate a ridere di ciò che ci faceva ridere insieme
Sorridete pensate a me',pregate per -PRON-
Che il mio nome sia pronunciato in casa come lo è sempre stato
Senza alcuna enfasi senza alcuna ombra di tristezza
La vita ha il significato di sempre il filo non si è spezzato
Perché dovrei essere fuori dai vostri pensieri
semplicemente perché sono fuori dalla vostra vista
Io non sono lontano
sono solo dall altro lato del cammino
To -PRON- -PRON- beautiful Angel miss -PRON- and love -PRON- ever in -PRON- ❤ ️.
Poem for Rosie and -PRON- love one
the little Prince
and at night -PRON- will look up to the star

In one of those star -PRON- shall be laugh and when -PRON- sorrow be comfort -PRON- will be content that -PRON- have know -PRON-
To an angel -PRON- imagine -PRON- at peace sleep well thank -PRON- for -PRON- smile which have imprint on -PRON- heart -PRON- have pass a mountain peak and -PRON- soul be soar in the firmament of complete and unbound freedom -PRON- be far far away -PRON- companion and the cloud be hide the hill from -PRON- eye
the valley be become flood with an ocean of silence the hand of oblivion be engulf the road and the house the prairie and field be disappear behind a white spectre that look like the spring cloud yellow as the candlelight and red as the twilight
the song of the wave and the human of the the stream be scatter and the voice of the throng reduce to silence
and -PRON- can hear naught but the music of Eternity in exact harmony with the spirit desire
-PRON- be cloak in full whiteness -PRON- be in comfort -PRON- be in peace
