Dear Smith family If someone would ask -PRON- who -PRON- admire most in life Gene Smith would be at the top of the list
a true rag to riches story
From struggle farmer to aerospace engineer
From live in a run down farm house with no running water to a home with a swimming pool
-PRON- be so full of wonderful_memory about Gene and Barb
-PRON- be so thankful that -PRON- have be part_of -PRON- life
the story Gene would tell about Uncle Boyd and Aunt Virginia live out on the farm be priceless
Gene relay that during World War II sugar be ration
Boyd decide to bury -PRON- sugar to hide -PRON- from the authority regretfully -PRON- forget where -PRON- bury -PRON-
This bury treasure become an urban legend and somehow the sugar be morph to money
-PRON- know where Gene get -PRON- sense_of humor and adventure from -PRON- father Boyd
Boyd be a real character
-PRON- wife Virginia be the most kind good humor and easy go person on_earth -PRON- have to be to off set -PRON- risk take husband
apparently when Gene be a young teenager and just learn to fly -PRON- dad be in the hospital and simply check -PRON- out
-PRON- call Gene and tell -PRON- to get in the airplane and come get -PRON-
when the young inexperienced pilot land in Cedar Rapids there be Boyd at the end of the runway wait_for -PRON-
other story Gene tell about Boyd ’s adventure with the airplane involve several crash
accord to Gene one accident result in Boyd be scalp and Virginia break several bone
-PRON- guess -PRON- could call Boyd one lucky aviator
-PRON- recently run_into a man at the Brooklyn nursing home Bob Murtha who be a pilot in WWII -PRON- ask -PRON- why -PRON- do_not have an airplane
-PRON- giggle and respond
-PRON- uncle wreck -PRON-
Gene ’s nickname be
Guts
-PRON- do_not back down from a fight
and -PRON- be willing to take a risk
-PRON- be home in Victor over Christmas and join Dad ’s coffee crew
one of Gene ’s friend Don Branyon be there and tell the story of how Gene and -PRON- good_friend in high_school would get into argument while -PRON- be in the car
Gene would pull over the two would get out settle -PRON- difference with a fist fight and get back the car like nothing have happen
This happen many many time and accord to Don Gene would win the verbal argument but fall short with the fist
-PRON- remember go to Los Angeles as a child and go with the Smith kid to Knott ’s Berry Farm and Disneyland
-PRON- especially remember one New_Year ’s_Day when -PRON- attempt to attend the Rose Bowl Parade
the problem be that -PRON- be so foggy -PRON- could not see
Gene be drive through fog with Uncle Chuck walk in front of the car guide -PRON- through the bad
a car with a boat attach to -PRON- roof run a light crash into the car in front and the boat go sail down the street
Once -PRON- finally arrive at the parade -PRON- be so crowded that -PRON- could not see a thing
Gene be the good story teller -PRON- have ever encounter
Gene and Dad Don be raise more like brother than first cousin
the good Thanksgivings -PRON- ever experience be those when Gene Barb Mom and Dad would come to celebrate
-PRON- would stand mesmerize at -PRON- island in the kitchen as Gene would entertain -PRON- with story of Boyd Virginia and adventure with Dad
Gene and Dad ’s
shenanigan go way back
one time when Gene be in detention at school and be force to write
-PRON- will not fill in the blank 100 time on the blackboard
-PRON- Dad climb up to the second story cling to the side of the building -PRON- inch -PRON- way to the classroom crawl in the window and help Gene finish -PRON- punishment
the plan be foil when the teacher walk in and see Dad ’s shoe stick out from under -PRON- desk
another Don and Gene adventure that stick out involve a shatter windshield
Dad Gene and Lowell Jack be on -PRON- way to a music festival in Williamsburg in Grandpa Raymond ’s 1937 Chevy
For_some stupid reason Gene bring along Uncle Boyd ’s loaded pistol
Lowell think -PRON- be a toy gun grab the gun and point -PRON- at Gene ’s head
Gene knock -PRON- away just in time the gun go off and shatter the windshield
-PRON- drive the car to a dealership in nearby Marengo for repair where the owner realize there be something fishy go on and call -PRON- parent
the three teenager make up a plausible excuse practice -PRON- and convince -PRON- parent that -PRON- be simply a rock that shatter the windshield
the Smith Rohrer Nixon Thanksgivings could not be complete without a trip downtown DC to the Air and Space Museum
Gene would show -PRON- the Minute Man Missile and explain_how -PRON- be involve in -PRON- creation and why -PRON- be replace
even today when -PRON- be in the museum -PRON- go pay homage to Gene and -PRON- minute man missile
Dad and Gene be child of the great depression could not pass up a deal and could not stand throw away something that have any life leave in -PRON-
This philosophy regretfully match perfectly with -PRON- husband Brian
While Barb Mom and -PRON- be off have fun at a craft fair -PRON- give -PRON- husband the chore of go to the dump with strict order Do not come_back with more that -PRON- take
Dad Gene and Brian come_back snicker and brag that -PRON- have discover the art of dumpster diving
-PRON- also could not throw anything away while the three be present
-PRON- be constantly pull thing -PRON- to the trash question why -PRON- would throw this away
At one point -PRON- be try to make room in the refrigerator for leave over Thanksgiving dinner and throw some old grape away
several minute later -PRON- spot Dad and Gene hover over the waste basket pull grape out of the trash and eat -PRON- and lament why -PRON- would throw this away
These memory that -PRON- have of Gene and those -PRON- share with -PRON- be precious -PRON- be sorry -PRON- can_not tell -PRON- as well as the master story- teller -PRON-
-PRON- be truly one of a kind and as Jeff say -PRON- cross the finish line
-PRON- like to think of -PRON- as race across the finish line fist pump up in the air yell
what a ride

TIME
MACHINE a portrait of Rod Smith March 23 1998 during the project
Stags Leap Portrait of a Community in which Rod serve as writer in residence
and -PRON- serve as poet in residence
the restaurant Terra be unmemorable as in the sense_of immemorial
Since time immemorial -PRON- have be there perch in the left hand of the city of the christian saint Helena and as long as -PRON- sit -PRON- sense_of time vanishe utterly
watch melt off the wrist of the wait staff
-PRON- have even go to the sly extreme of make the antiquity of the wall look like a contemporary effect like faux faux as if this be a casual and recent establishment
but do_not let -PRON- fool -PRON-
Dinner here will evolve into conversation which provide intersection at which -PRON- can linger deep into the night with the Jupiter probe and the memory of -PRON- first love affair
-PRON- own thought and idea will arrive like so_many dish skillfully tailor and -PRON- will unabashedly share that indelicate greed of the moment of cinnamon and the raw flesh of fish tenderly bed down over lettuce
and across the table in this meal which last -PRON- whole lifetime sit Rod Smith dress in -PRON- black italian suit relax -PRON- vigilance alert the menu to -PRON- presence and -PRON- every appetite and what a meal become when Rod wield the wine list be something -PRON- will whisper to -PRON- grandchild
rod -PRON- will tell -PRON- -PRON- be the priest of wine for surely there be such_a priesthood for those_who take vow of sensuality and apply careful thought like a spritz of lemon to the smoke rise off the grill
and as -PRON- lift the glass to -PRON- lip -PRON- feel a sensation in -PRON- own gullet and realize that this be the Vicarious Supper Club and in the medium of wine -PRON- can learn more by watch than -PRON- ever could again by taste
and so -PRON- sit in a bouquet of time fragrant with grape harvest long past and by the time dessert arrive chaperone by port and a distillation of coffee bean -PRON- have no need ever again to be afraid of -PRON- hunger
Rod be with Dana when -PRON- know -PRON-
when -PRON- first meet -PRON- -PRON- be blow away that wine could mean so_many thing but when -PRON- probe -PRON- to try and describe the taste -PRON- start to understand -PRON- detail and truthful imagination in the description
As -PRON- be transition in career -PRON- move in with -PRON- then boyfriend and Rod come to -PRON- home to help -PRON- pack -PRON- box
when -PRON- get to Mark 's the boyfriend place -PRON- must have look quite pale and unprepared for this step and -PRON- see that
-PRON- pull -PRON- aside and say -PRON- could move -PRON- out as easily as -PRON- could move -PRON- in
-PRON- be reassure handsome and unique
-PRON- love -PRON- through Dana and -PRON- new find love for wine and all -PRON- could be
sadness fill -PRON- heart for -PRON- family -PRON- child and for have a torment that possess -PRON- and lead -PRON- to leave -PRON- all
rod and -PRON- meet in college and spend some time together in San_Francisco in the late 70
-PRON- writing career be just a dream at that point
and -PRON- be happy to discover
when -PRON- reconnecte some 30_year later that -PRON- achieve some great measure of success be marry and have two wonderful kid
and now this a death far_too young and far_too soon
-PRON- be sorry -PRON- never reconnecte in person in recent year but be grateful -PRON- be in touch
-PRON- mourn -PRON- passing and the passing of the adventure -PRON- share when -PRON- be young and the world be young

no_one could leap high and low like Rodric Mar Smith
greasy chow fun in an ancient curtain Chinatown booth for lunch dinner at French Laundry
Rod revere America an un air condition throwback America populate by the gambler rum runner train hopper and cowboy in Grateful Dead song
-PRON- be at a Dead concert by the way where Rod save -PRON- ass
there -PRON- be by the Winterland stage nineteen seventy something sway to a symphonic Terrapin when the soundwave and crowd heat among other thing short circuit -PRON- head
when -PRON- come to on the floor Rod have elbow out breathing space from the writhe crowd and be fan -PRON- with -PRON- shirt
-PRON- feel safe
safe under Rod_’s wing
As year unfold and -PRON- move up to the Northwest -PRON- still buy ticket to the Dead when -PRON- be nearby Rod follow -PRON- across America and get in backstage
whatever scene -PRON- be
Rod do -PRON- big and bold
-PRON- do a little boating around Puget Sound Rod sail the Pacific
-PRON- cover crime and business for a newspaper Rod roam the world reinvent wine writing and never punch a clock
what do Rod even see in a klutz like -PRON-
Anything beyond -PRON- devoted reflection
and yet there -PRON- be the most dapper wedding guest toast -PRON- bride before -PRON- later nurse -PRON- wounded heart after -PRON- untimely_death
there -PRON- still be meet up to retrace battle trench in France and Jack London ’s footstep in California
These of_course be Rod_’s passion
-PRON- steer the boat
Truth be tell always be epic get tiresome maybe even tyrannical
rod once pronounce in all seriousness that -PRON- could never live in an American League city because of -PRON- insipid designate Hitter rule -PRON- live in an American League city
and so around the turn of the millennium -PRON- come to see that
if -PRON- ever be to to find -PRON- own way -PRON- need more distance from Rod_’s blind flame
-PRON- be not anything that be announce
neither of -PRON- ¬— preoccupy with new wife home and gig necessarily intend to let -PRON- foundational friendship fade
-PRON- just do
-PRON- have not see Rod in almost 20_year when -PRON- hear that -PRON- have die
how many time have -PRON- think_about try to reconnect
to thank -PRON- for all -PRON- have teach -PRON- for the bravado that -PRON- have lend to -PRON- meager store
and to explain that -PRON- be not his fault
-PRON- have pick the part_of Robin to -PRON- Batman until -PRON- could not play -PRON- anymore
that be on -PRON-
-PRON- do_not know that the door be close
another lesson from Rod do_not wait around for shit
-PRON- do_not witness or at_least notice
the despair that -PRON- now know haunt Rod
what -PRON- have hear about -PRON- death anger and sadden -PRON-
now -PRON- have a choice wallow in regret over not pick_up the phone
Seethe in anger that -PRON- do
not give -PRON- the chance
seek out new hero to worship
For this moment at_least -PRON- just choose to be grateful for know Rod when -PRON- need a friend and a hero and when -PRON- think -PRON- need -PRON-
-PRON- love you MAMA
-PRON- HURT so
much from STIL miss you
THERES
so_much
-PRON- wish
-PRON- COULD tell you
test in peace

As -PRON- happen in life people move and live change and -PRON- see and speak with each_other less frequently but in reality the group be still intact inside of -PRON-
the two_year -PRON- be roommate in the Back Bay be when -PRON- really get to know each_other

After those two_year life happen and here -PRON- be
a sad day fill with wonderful_memory
how often do -PRON- the loudmouth wise ass carry_on with some antic story or self embarrassment only to have -PRON- sum -PRON- up with a word

As -PRON- write in August 2017 Sandy be a wonderful college classmate who leave -PRON- much too_soon
As a waiter dishwasher in -PRON- sorority house for three_year -PRON- see -PRON- often and recall -PRON- well

-PRON- do_not want to snitch on the source
uhh
yes
-PRON- do
-PRON- be Ann and Ruth
-PRON- all be have dinner in the village and
at some point Sandy go to the lady room
only when -PRON- be go do
Ann and Ruth tell -PRON- the tale of Sandy 's reaction to another faux pas by the Kelley family
seem to be a habit with -PRON-
-PRON- uproot and take out quite a_few tree down by the shore presumably because of -PRON- condition
i'm not sure -PRON- reason
be vaguely responsible folk -PRON- doubt -PRON- intent be to annoy anybody least of all Sandy
well when Sandy arrive and see the relatively empty space where the tree have be locate Ann and Ruth say -PRON- go down to the area and count how many have be take down each one needlessly in -PRON- opinion
mom and sis say -PRON- could hear -PRON- counting as -PRON- examine the ground count unhappily for sure
-PRON- gather that this be not a one time activity for Sandy
-PRON- apparently go down several time do the counting thing several time each time get a high number become more upset after each visit
This story lead to a_few laugh at the table for both Ruth and Ann and -PRON-
absolutely all of those laugh occur when Sandy be absent_from the table and upon -PRON- return the topic of conversation abruptly change
no mention of tree or -PRON- absence due to Mom and sis be aware that -PRON- mention may spoil the entrée and the occasion for San
-PRON- have be think_about -PRON- this week dear_friend as -PRON- birthday draw near
-PRON- be remember -PRON- visit to Columbia City when -PRON- travel for PBS

-PRON- be easy to see that -PRON- be genuine care funny and thoughtful
-PRON- keep in touch via email until not that long ago and -PRON- miss hear from -PRON-
Sandy be -PRON- Big Sister in -PRON- college sorority 50 year_ago and after graduation be -PRON- roommate in Denver for two_year
-PRON- always get along well though -PRON- be often the recipient of -PRON- prank
-PRON- do have an impish streak
Sandy be down to earth and honest
-PRON- do_not seek attention or try to flatter or dissemble
-PRON- have keep -PRON- friendship over the year

-PRON- share a love of dog the mountain and the Adirondacks
whatever Sandy approached-
-PRON- do with precision and speed
This include drive

-PRON- will miss Sandy but generation of student teacher and television professional will continue to benefit from -PRON- work and -PRON- pizazz
thank -PRON- Sandy
-PRON- know that Sandy have a deep and abide love for Rocky Bay camp in the Adirondacks all -PRON- life
-PRON- recall when the current owner
the Kelley Family instal stair from the dock to the cabin in an effort to give a boost to any visitor of a certain age
certainly the original path be rocky and a bit twisty and may reasonably lead to a tumble or two
-PRON- intent be honorable
but
-PRON- hear from Ann and Ruth that Sandy be kind of offend by this new fangle entrance and be determined to keep to the olde tyme way of go up the hill
so -PRON- purposefully and nobly avoid the stair for a while and go up to the cabin in a circuitous route which be even rocky and risky than the original path
-PRON- choice
-PRON- suspect would have draw cheer from a variety of olde time Rocky Bay camp soul include -PRON- Dad Gret and Baba
here be to all of the story tell meal share hike with dog sunrise and sunset in Fairplay over the last 25 +_year

naturally -PRON- say yes
-PRON- arrive shortly afterwards and spend several hour visit with -PRON-
-PRON- then present -PRON- with a sign copy of -PRON- book something -PRON- will cherish forever
-PRON- be the beginning of a friendship that last until -PRON- passing
-PRON- visit each_other quite frequently share a meal story and each_other ’s company
perhaps -PRON- be old fashion but after 5_year -PRON- still call -PRON- Mr._Johnson
-PRON- be mention by almost everyone that Mr._Johnson could be very open however -PRON- also have a private side
there be time -PRON- would call and if -PRON- do_not feel_like talk -PRON- simply would not answer the phone
Although -PRON- respect -PRON- privacy in this matter -PRON- give way to the few time -PRON- call -PRON- Joe
-PRON- be -PRON- way to get -PRON- attention and let -PRON- know -PRON- be concerned_about -PRON-
one time -PRON- call without a response only to learn a pilot friend of -PRON- fly -PRON- to White Sands New Mexico to visit the Bataan Memorial near there
thus when -PRON- initially be unable to contact -PRON- one day in June
-PRON- simply figure -PRON- be not home or do_not want to talk at that time
a while later Michele insist -PRON- try call -PRON- again
This time -PRON- leave a message say if -PRON- do_not call back within 5 minute -PRON- would call the sheriff ’s department
In the past this approach work well but not this time
-PRON- then drive to -PRON- home and do_not receive a response at the door
-PRON- then call the sheriff ’s department who gain entry to the house and find Mr._Johnson decease
-PRON- be completely devastate
-PRON- be such_a great friend who will always be remember fondly for -PRON- wit gracious smile and dear fellowship
As -PRON- husband previously mention -PRON- meet Mr._Johnson on 7 December 2012 during a tribute to World War II
Since then -PRON- have visit -PRON- home many time and -PRON- have become good_friend
-PRON- always provide an interesting view on -PRON- experience and history
-PRON- share many meal and -PRON- always have a way to let -PRON- know what -PRON- would like for a future meal and naturally pecan pie for desert
pecan pie be -PRON- favorite and not to be confuse with pizza pie
-PRON- tell -PRON- as a pow the main talk be always about food
naturally be from the South -PRON- crave fry chicken and always wonder_what the Yankees be talk_about whenever -PRON- mention pizza pie
-PRON- be completely confused when -PRON- describe a pizza
In fact -PRON- say -PRON- have -PRON- first pizza when -PRON- be station in California
thus -PRON- make_sure -PRON- always have pecan pie or pecan ice_cream for dessert
-PRON- be 91 year_old in January 2017 and still sharp as a tack
once while visit -PRON- -PRON- learn -PRON- be from France
-PRON- tell -PRON- -PRON- 6th grade music teacher be from France and -PRON- teach the class the french national anthem La Marseillaise in English
Mr._Johnson immediately sing the entire anthem without miss a word or note
As -PRON- tell -PRON- several time -PRON- mind be both a blessing and a curse
-PRON- have very similar background
-PRON- both grow_up poor and -PRON- be able to relate to each_other ’s situation such as go to bed hungry do daily chore
-PRON- believe read -PRON- book_Baby of Bataan would be an_inspiration to all Americans especially the youth of -PRON- country
read -PRON- and -PRON- will have a great appreciation of those_who serve -PRON- country during that difficult_time
As Richard -PRON- too could not bring -PRON- to call -PRON- by -PRON- first name
-PRON- european upbringing simply teach -PRON- to respect -PRON- elder
-PRON- will always think of -PRON- fondly and remember the wonderful time -PRON- share together even the time -PRON- do_not feel_like answer -PRON- question or agree with -PRON- comment
-PRON- would simply give -PRON- that infectious_smile and act as though -PRON- do_not hear -PRON- and quickly change the subject
Met Joe via Tom Zmugg and boy be -PRON- glad
-PRON- have -PRON- over for dinner a number of time that prove to be so entertaining enlightening educational enjoyable
-PRON- wish everyone could have know -PRON-
the world be a well_place because of -PRON- and -PRON- lose can_not be replace
May -PRON- rest_In Peace

Abraham Lincoln
-PRON- beloved Uncle_Joe pass_away last month on -PRON- birthday and since then -PRON- have be struggle to find an appropriate way to honor and celebrate -PRON- memory and life
-PRON- know that -PRON- word could never do justice to -PRON- memory and -PRON- life so all -PRON- can do be share -PRON- own memory of the man -PRON- come to love respect and admire
-PRON- be not the year in -PRON- life that count but the life in -PRON- year
-PRON- can_not think of any word that good describe Joseph Q. Johnson 's life than these word
From an early_age and even into adulthood -PRON- relationship with -PRON- go far beyond just be blood relate
Over the year -PRON- have hear many_people describe someone as large than life and this phrase fit -PRON- Uncle_Joe both figuratively and literally
even_though -PRON- do_not play a major role in -PRON- upbringing Uncle_Joe teach -PRON- many thing
thing that have in many way shape -PRON- into the person -PRON- be today
the jury be still out on whether or not that s a good thing but that be a story for another time
love of country family mexican food golf movie baseball the importance of a sense_of humor be just a_few
While grow_up in Memphis -PRON- look_forward to many thing
holiday Birthdays family_gathering hit the link go to the movie etc
but the thing -PRON- look_forward to the most be when Uncle_Joe come to town
For -PRON- -PRON- be every holiday and special occasion roll into one
-PRON- always have a big smile on -PRON- face and -PRON- always treat -PRON- and -PRON- sibling as if -PRON- be -PRON- own kid
-PRON- be always captivate by -PRON- story joke and -PRON- infectious_laugh
back then -PRON- do_not even know the meaning of sarcasm and cynicism but Uncle_Joe be a master
-PRON- be never cruel with -PRON- sarcasm but -PRON- always recognize bullshit when -PRON- see -PRON-
and -PRON- do_not matter who -PRON- be
If anyone and -PRON- do mean anyone spewed bullshit Uncle_Joe would call -PRON- out with a twinkle in -PRON- eye and tongue firmly implant in cheek
Uncle_Joe always make -PRON- laugh even when -PRON- be the butt of one of -PRON- joke
and believe -PRON- there be many
put simply Uncle_Joe be -PRON- hero
sure -PRON- put -PRON- high up on a pedestal and nothing would please -PRON- more if -PRON- make -PRON- smile or laugh at one of -PRON- joke
-PRON- could listen to -PRON- talk and tell -PRON- story for hour
grow_up one of the thing that always strike -PRON- as curious be that whenever Uncle_Joe come to town -PRON- Mother would always tell -PRON- not to ask -PRON- about -PRON- experience in the war
-PRON- reasoning for this be that -PRON- would get upset and angry
-PRON- do_not like to revisit the horror -PRON- experience
be young and naive -PRON- do what be ask because -PRON- certainly do_not want Uncle_Joe to be mad_at -PRON-
the irony of this be
that year later -PRON- pass this information to -PRON- and -PRON- response be classic Uncle_Joe
With a roll of the eye and a big guffaw -PRON- retort -PRON- Mother be full of shit
-PRON- do_not mind talk_about -PRON- experience at all
-PRON- bring this up because grow_up -PRON- really be not aware of the hardship -PRON- experience
-PRON- know that -PRON- serve during World War II and that -PRON- be a pow and that be pretty much -PRON-
As a dumb naive kid -PRON- just know how_much -PRON- love and respect -PRON-
-PRON- look_forward to -PRON- visit much like a kid look_forward to Christmas
As the year go_by -PRON- learn more and more about -PRON- life from -PRON- interaction and conversation with -PRON- and those close to -PRON-
-PRON- never really understand the extent of the cruelty and brutality -PRON- endure until 2004 when -PRON- publish -PRON- memoir Baby of Bataan
one example of -PRON- character be that prior to the publication of -PRON- memoir -PRON- receive an_email from -PRON- want idea for the title of -PRON- book
-PRON- answer be of_course Baby of Bataan and -PRON- response be typical Uncle_Joe
-PRON- say that the general consensus be that -PRON- be the perfect title for -PRON- book but in truth -PRON- know many young_man that serve in Bataan that deserve that title just as much as -PRON- do
In the forward to -PRON- memoir retire Colonel Karl Lowe say -PRON- best
Joe 's character -PRON- unsung duty and bravery under fire and -PRON- ability to endure the cruelty brutality and savagery of -PRON- captor be -PRON- test of true grit
that -PRON- emerge with -PRON- mind and dignity intact be the essence of what -PRON- find in Joe and -PRON- generation
In closing -PRON- have always be a humbling experience for -PRON- whenever -PRON- think_about the thing -PRON- experience and endure from the age of 14 19
Acne scrap knee broken bone curfew homework awkward first kiss ROTC school boy crush to name just a_few
and then -PRON- think back to what Uncle_Joe go through at that age
and -PRON- be remind that what -PRON- go through be nothing in comparison
In -PRON- life -PRON- have always try to honor Uncle_Joe and -PRON- memory
-PRON- name -PRON- first_bear son after -PRON-
-PRON- talk_about -PRON- to anyone who would listen
-PRON- think_about -PRON- every time -PRON- play a round of golf
every time -PRON- hear a good joke -PRON- think Uncle_Joe would have like that joke
-PRON- wish -PRON- could have witness -PRON- reaction when candidate Donald Trump say POW 's be not hero 's
-PRON- like guy that do_not get capture
even_though -PRON- have now go to the clearing at the end of the path -PRON- spirit and memory will live_on in all of the lucky one who know and love -PRON-
-PRON- will never be forget
John R. Buddy
Graig
Joe Johnson be a humble thoughtful compassionate man
-PRON- try very hard to contact family of pow that -PRON- know who do_not return home and provide closure for -PRON-
In one of the conversation -PRON- have with Joe
-PRON- ask -PRON- if Judy and -PRON- ever travel to Maine to look for a town call Hinckley and see if -PRON- could find someone that know the Hinckley family
James Hinckley be a fellow pow and -PRON- want to provide closure for the family
On one of -PRON- RV trip to the NE -PRON- wound up in Booth Bay ME for about a week
While there -PRON- decide to take a drive and see if -PRON- could find Hinckley ME
After locate -PRON- on a map -PRON- start drive
-PRON- pass a Hinckley town limit sign and stop at the first convenience store -PRON- come to
the clerk there do_not know anyone in the Hinckley family but tell -PRON- that if -PRON- come in from the east on the route -PRON- be on
-PRON- pass a school found by the Hinckley family
the librarian there be more or less the town historian and -PRON- may be able to help -PRON-
back at the library the lady there research all of -PRON- information on the Hinckley family and could not find anything on a James Hinckley
-PRON- say -PRON- be possible that one of the wayfaring student at the school may have use the Hinckley name to enlist
-PRON- tell -PRON- that there be a memorial at the top of the hill on the school ground that list all of the Hinckley family that die in all war and that the visitor ’s center at the bottom of the hill may have some additional information
the memorial only list one wwii POW a Norman Hinckley

-PRON- give -PRON- a copy of the picture and accompany caption
when Joe receive the picture -PRON- exclaim
that ’s the man
wonder_why -PRON- call -PRON- James
anyway from the information accompany the picture Joe be able to locate a sister live in WV and provide closure

Steve set_up this webpage as a memorial to Joe
accordingly -PRON- will be add post from time to time to help everyone get to know Joe better
This post be about the publishing and sale of Joe_’s book_Baby of Bataan

Ace Godshall
a retire Marine MasterSGT friend of -PRON-
Dr. Robert Wood
a former Marine author of a book title
Good By Viet Nam and owner of the publishing company OMONOMONY
Gene Adee
a retired military pilot O-6 Navy or AF associate of an organization Voices take Flight that recognize citizen who have make major contribution to -PRON- society and one of the organizer of the annual Memorial_Day Ride to the Wall
shortly after -PRON- wife Judy
and -PRON- start Rving -PRON- be back in Memphis
-PRON- be have a conversation with Ace Godshall about some thing -PRON- feel be miss for Rvers
-PRON- be difficult to find a place to get an oil change and to find a place where -PRON- could get -PRON- rv wash
-PRON- tell -PRON- about a friend that may be interested in hear -PRON- idea and perhaps finance -PRON-
Ace set_up a luncheon where -PRON- introduce -PRON- to Dr Wood
-PRON- ask -PRON- how -PRON- happen to know Ace
-PRON- tell -PRON- that Ace save -PRON- life in Viet Nam not once but twice
Ace be a crew chief and door gunner on a Marine helicopter and air lift Dr. Wood out of danger twice
immediately -PRON- respect for Ace jump up a couple of notch
now on to Joe_’s book
when Joe finish -PRON- book -PRON- start look for a publisher
In the world of writer if -PRON- be an unknown no big publishing company have time for -PRON-
If -PRON- find an unknown publisher to publish -PRON- book nobody buy book from unknown publisher
Judy and -PRON- contact many of -PRON- friend look for idea to help Joe find a publisher
By now -PRON- be in the Memphis area again in -PRON- RV travel and in another conversation with Ace
-PRON- tell -PRON- about Joe and -PRON- problem find a publisher
Ace tell -PRON- that Dr. Wood have write a book since -PRON- meet -PRON- and have start -PRON- own publishing company because -PRON- could not find a publisher
After contact Dr. Wood and Joe -PRON- leave thing up to -PRON-
Dr. Wood arrange for Joe to come to Memphi s Ace pick -PRON- up at the airport because by -PRON-
Judy and
-PRON- be on the road again in -PRON- RV
Joe_’s book be publish in 2004
now the problem be get -PRON- sell
-PRON- carry a couple of case of Joe_’s book that -PRON- sell to friend along the RV trail
and -PRON- build a website for -PRON-
not much help there
aside from -PRON- publisher the individual who do the most to help Joe with book sale be Gene Adee
gene nominate Joe for the annual award present by the association
Voices take Flight
Joe be select as -PRON- honoree for that year and the ceremony be widely publicize in the Phoenix area but not so_much nationwide

the Marines immediately approach Joe and coax -PRON- into join -PRON- unit
-PRON- tell -PRON- -PRON- never go anywheere or do much and -PRON- want -PRON- on -PRON- ball team

Boy do -PRON- love Jim Johnson
-PRON- be so_sorry to hear of -PRON- passing
-PRON- wish -PRON- all peace in spite of what must be a terrible loss
-PRON- first meet Rev. Johnson back in the early eighty
-PRON- become one of -PRON- student in -PRON- first confirmation class
through the year -PRON- and -PRON- family become treasured friend to -PRON- family
-PRON- always seem to have a good understanding for people and be always able to make connection no_matter who -PRON- be
-PRON- be -PRON- teacher
-PRON- speak at -PRON- high_school graduation
-PRON- officiate -PRON- wedding
-PRON- come to check on -PRON- after -PRON- have a car accident
-PRON- be a man of the people -PRON- be an_incredible minister and -PRON- know -PRON- will be miss
-PRON- grandfather pass_away several week_ago now but every time -PRON- try to write this
-PRON- write -PRON- as if -PRON- ’s a letter -PRON- be will send -PRON-
however -PRON- can_not receive these kind of letter anymore and that simple fact be hard to understand
Grandpa Johnson be without a doubt one of the most_important people in -PRON- life and have truly shape -PRON- into the person -PRON- be today
-PRON- be a man of God and dedicate -PRON- life to not only -PRON- family but all those_who surround -PRON-
This be not just show during -PRON- time in education or as a reverend
This be demonstrate in -PRON- every_day life
-PRON- remember go to the grocery store late one night with -PRON- grandma and grandpa -PRON- be kind of in a rush
so -PRON- be an in and out kind of deal
-PRON- grandpa spot this young_man stack orange and decide -PRON- be the perfect person to strike up a conversation with
-PRON- sit there for 20 minute big travel delay learn about this kid ’s life and aspiration then at the end -PRON- give -PRON- some of -PRON- invaluable advice and parted way
This be a common interaction for -PRON- grandpa and some of -PRON- read this may have experience -PRON- -PRON-
-PRON- be continuously try to teach -PRON- new thing from self defense Karate on the staircase landing to perspective art technique at the high top table
-PRON- would challenge -PRON- to Sudoku puzzle and make_sure -PRON- think -PRON- be the smart kid ever
-PRON- be proud of every art project -PRON- do and marvel at each of -PRON- even when -PRON- just mix the perfect color for rust
-PRON- teach -PRON- basic skill for home renovation and put -PRON- to the test on -PRON- own home
most_importantly -PRON- grandpa care deeply about -PRON- moral and spiritual development
-PRON- would sit for hour discuss what -PRON- believe in and how -PRON- think thing should be and -PRON- would never push -PRON- opinion on -PRON-
-PRON- would offer -PRON- guidance but never to hinder -PRON- own path of self growth
day before -PRON- head off to report to Beast Barracks at the United_States Military Academy -PRON- grandpa sit -PRON- down to talk_about faith
This time in a much different respect than before
-PRON- want to make_sure -PRON- believe in something
-PRON- truly feel that if -PRON- believe in something -PRON- would never be alone and could always find the strength -PRON- would need to make -PRON- through any tribulation -PRON- may face
every year -PRON- find -PRON- word to be truer
-PRON- have so_many memory -PRON- want to share with everyone because -PRON- only regret now be that -PRON- never get to introduce -PRON- to everyone in -PRON- life
-PRON- wish -PRON- all could have know -PRON- and in the manner -PRON- have
-PRON- be thankful that so_much of -PRON- live_on through -PRON- and -PRON- brother
-PRON- be thankful that -PRON- parent make -PRON- an integral part_of -PRON- life because -PRON- have be the good mentor and influence -PRON- could have ever hope for
-PRON- be thankful -PRON- get to video chat with -PRON- from Portland
or while -PRON- be at the hospital in Portland ME because that be -PRON- last conversation before -PRON- unexpectedly pass_away
-PRON- will always miss -PRON-
-PRON- loss be heaven 's gain
Rev. Johnson be an integral part_of -PRON- life when -PRON- be a young wife and mother
spiritual guidance at that point in -PRON- life be essential
-PRON- prayer go out to Shirley and the whole family as well as gratitude for share -PRON- with -PRON- all those year

Ciao Amore come mi
dicevi sempre tu
★
è tutta la mattina che cerco di sedermi e scriverti ma una parte di -PRON- non vuole farlo
Questa parte di -PRON- è così arrabbiata che preferisce quasi fare finta di nulla
Sedermi qua a scriverti ora è
un po come ammettere di aver accettato che
non ci sei che è già passato un anno e
questo no non lo voglio accettare
Ma d’altra parte ho una tremenda voglia di parlarti
e questo è l’unico mezzo che ho e in cui mi sento ascoltata
quindi eccomi qua
una anno c’è già tutto
questo
tempo che ci divide
Un anno dall’ultima volta che ti
ho
visto un anno dall’ultima volta che ti ho parlato ascoltato abbracciato
se c’è una cosa di cui ringrazio -PRON- stessa è quella di essermi costretta a venire da te
quei primo di marzo di un anno fa
ciò mi ha dato l’opportunità di poterti stringere la mano di poterti accompagnare
di porti abbracciare
Ho potuto ascoltare per l’ultima
volta quel tuo ciao amore che mi hai sempre detto con tanta dolcezza
Ho potuto scorgere in un tuo
piccolo gesto fatto a fatica tutto l’amore che ci hai sempre donato
Ho potuto ammirare la tua incredibile forza la tua gioia e la tua pazzia anche quando le forze
ti abbandonavano
non -PRON- lo sarei mai perdonata se non avessi avuto
la forza di accompagnarti nella fine
perché è lì che più mi hai insegnato la vita e l’amore
e per questo ti ringrazio
Mi hai insegnato cosa vuol dire vivere
cosa vuol dire combattere quanto importante sia affrontare ogni
singolo giorno col sorriso e con la gioia che avevi tu e soprattutto mi hai insegnato che l’amore supera qualsiasi cosa anche la vita terrena
Sei la mamma più coraggiosa ed incredibile che conosca
Mi manchi sempre
i ✿ love -PRON- tanto tanto tanto
tua sempre Sofi ❤
ho tanta voglia di tenerti tra le mie braccia come quando erii con noi
passa il tempo ma diventa sempre piu duro amore di mamma
As time go_by -PRON- seem -PRON- be the kind of person_who live_on in -PRON- life forever although the pain never go the joy of remember -PRON- infectious love for life family and friend make -PRON- smile on a daily basis when -PRON- think of -PRON-
forever miss forever love especially the super dessert that always make -PRON- run faster
Auguri di compleanno su con gli
angeli e duro quaggiu non vedo l'ora di vederti
Tanti auguri angelo celeste
sempre nel cuore
Auguri Rosie pensando a te oggi domani e sempre nel cuore sarrai
13 settimane sono passate da che sei
andata.domani sono gia 3 mesi la verita e tu sai come mi
potro mai sentire
io.certo
no ce molto cambio rimane sempre
la scusa di oggi vieni da noi e stai qua con noi .mi rendo conto che
sei con
noi.anche se io ho tanta voglio di abbracciarti anche solo per un instante
Tesoro lo faccio sempre attraverso Isabella io ti vedo in lei due gocce
ti mando carezze e baci
a presto
quanto mi manchi
ci sono giorni che nemmeno -PRON- ne rendo conto
aspetto tue notizie quelle notifiche su facebook che eri solita lasciarmi
o la chiamata del giorno
poi mi accorgo
di non poter più avere tutto ciò
così inizio a ricordarti a cercarti nelle foto
nelle cose vecchie che mi hai scritto è l'unico modo che ho per sentirti vicina a -PRON-
quanto darei per un tuo abbraccio
e una tua parola ora
MI MANCHI sempre
troppo
Lo so che ci sei Amore
Ti sento costantemente
ma che voglia avrei di vederti e riabbracciarti
Carissima la mia vita e un immenso vuoto.vivi per vivere tutti cercano di
consolarmi
ma nessuno
mi capishe
Ogni giorno Che passa sempre piu peasante .non
so dove sarei senza il tuo angelo.sicuramente lontano
da dove
sono adesso .vorrei
essere
la vicino per chiederti tante cose avere tante risposte
MI MANCHI SEPRE PIU XXX
ieri siamo stati tutti noi con il tuo angelo non crede assolutamente che sei volata via con
-PRON- palloncini
.io
so che
tu non smetterai mai di protergela da lassu
e noi no smetteremo mai di tenerti dappertutto in casa tu sei la sua mamma e
le manchi tanto.ti ama MAMMA
In momenti come questi non riesco a credere che
tu non ci sia
Non mi sembra normale aspetto il momento in cui riceverò
una tua chiamata vedrò una tua notifica leggerò una tua mail
Io lo
so che ci sei ieri c'eri oggi anche
ci sarai domani Ti fai sempre sentire oggi eri in
-PRON- be yours lt;3

La morte non è niente io sono solo andato nella stanza accanto
Io sono io voi siete voi
Ciò che ero per voi lo sono sempre
Datemi il nome che mi avete sempre dato parlatemi come mi avete sempre parlato non usate mai in tono diverso
non abbiate un aria solenne o triste continuate a ridere di ciò che ci faceva ridere insieme
Sorridete pensate a me',pregate per -PRON-
Che il mio nome sia pronunciato in casa come lo è sempre stato
Senza alcuna enfasi senza alcuna ombra di tristezza
La vita ha il significato di sempre il filo non si è spezzato
Perché dovrei essere fuori dai vostri pensieri
semplicemente perché sono fuori dalla vostra vista
Io non sono lontano
sono solo dall altro lato del cammino
To -PRON- -PRON- beautiful Angel miss -PRON- and love -PRON- ever in -PRON- ❤ ️.
Poem for Rosie and -PRON- love one

there be a time for everything and a season for every activity under heaven a time to be bear and a time to die a time to plant and a time to uproot a time to kill and a time to heal a time to tear down and a time to build a time to weep and a time to laugh a time to mourn and a time to dance a time to scatter stone and a time to gather -PRON- a time to embrace and a time to refrain a time to search and a time to give up a time to keep and a time to throw away a time to tear and a time to mend a time to be silent and a time to speak a time to love and a time to hate a time for war and a time for peace
-PRON- pray Gods peace in -PRON- life as -PRON- allow -PRON- heart to remember the laughter and good time that God so generously allow -PRON- to have with -PRON-
-PRON- do_not know the time place or day that God will call -PRON- home but -PRON- do know that God have prepare a place in_Heaven to call home

rosial favorite bible verse
the LORD be -PRON- shepherd -PRON- shall not want
-PRON- maketh -PRON- to lie down in green pasture -PRON- leadeth -PRON- beside the still water
-PRON- restoreth -PRON- soul -PRON- leadeth -PRON- in the path of righteousness for -PRON- name ’s sake
Yea though -PRON- walk through the valley of the shadow of death -PRON- will fear no evil
For thou art with -PRON- thy rod and thy staff -PRON- comfort -PRON-
Thou preparest a table before -PRON- in the presence of mine enemy
Thou anointest -PRON- head with oil -PRON- cup runneth over
surely goodness and mercy shall follow -PRON- all the day of -PRON- life and -PRON- will dwell in the house of the LORD forever
