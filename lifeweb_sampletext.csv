"Thank you so much for sharing this sad news with us.  I understand your ability to see the silver lining, but all those whose lives she touched so profoundly will surely miss her more than we can imagine. Tony, Marney, Julian, Governor, Michael,  our hearts go out to all of you, as we know she was so much more than a mother to you, but a dear friend. Your parents were such an important part of our lives as young newlyweds starting a new life in Alexandria - and here we are, nearly 50 years later, times filled with joy, mirth and sadness as we lose the generation who made our young lives so special through their many acts of kindness.  We will never forget that, ever. Creole and i look forward to catching up with all of you in April to celebrate the life of a lovely person who made the world a better place. Love, Bo"
"You don't know how much this saddens me, although, I understand the sweetness, too, of her passing. What a lovely, gracious, woman she was, and I will not forget her smile as she warmly welcomed me into her home the two or three times I was appeared.  That's trait is too rare these times. I keep you all in my thoughtful prayer. What a blessing she was!  Beautiful Polly."
"I am so sorry to hear about the recent passing of your mother.  Magee Whelan was kind enough to pass along your e-mail announcement. In 2007 I was temporarily insane and ran for the Virginia House of Delegates as a Republican from Alexandria.  Crazy, right?  But I will never forget the afternoon when your mother took me door to door from about the 300 block of Prince Street back down to the water by her house, introducing me to everyone she knew – which was, in fact, everyone.  She truly was the Mayor of Prince Street.
You are lucky to have had such a great mom.  And I was privileged to know her. You are all in my thoughts and prayers . . . "
"So sorry to receive this sad news. As you well know, she was one of our “favorites”!"
"To live life in all its chapters and a few extra days is a blessing beyond the normal- for her life, her smiles, her wit, and most of all for our knowing each other, there is both a tear and a smile--and to you all my love,"
"I just heard about your mom.  As you well know, she was a very special person in my and so many others lives.  I have such good memories of mom#2, from carpool to Bethany beach.  It is through those wonderful memories that she will continue to be a part of my life."
"Magee passed on the sad news about Polly.  We spent many great times together, especially during the George Allen elections and since."
"Marney we are thinking of you SO much.  Your Mom was one of my very favorite people - beautiful, smart, and hilarious!  I used to have so much fun working out next to her in the old aqua fitness room at BHCC.  Her passing is a huge loss for everyone she touched.  I will look forward to seeing you in April.  "
"My sympathy to you and your family in the loss of your/our great lady!!!  When Karen wrote to me on my day off to tell me the news, I said right away….”I love you Miss Polly” and actually felt her presence.  Then later that day, I was grilling outside and looked up at the sky, waved & said it again.  I hope that she went peacefully.  A lot of repeat guests have been asking about her the past couple of years……….she has been missed but she will always hold that “special” place in my/our heart(s).  "
So bitter sweet! Love you all and thanks for the news. 
"Aw, I had that feeling . Now, I know why. I had hoped to see her before mid-march.  She was a true friend to me and always had a good story to tell. She was as beautiful on the outside as she was in her heart. A lovely person, forever.Before I read your email, Julian, I had been in touch with my third  cousin, today to tell him that I would make a copy of the magazine , and the TV program that had a mention of him that you sent to me. Polly contacted the magazine to have them send me three copies.  I was thinking how kind she was to request them for  me, as I couldn't find it on any newstand. I loved living next door to All  of you.  You all made losing my dad so suddenly to a heart attack  2 days after my 21st birthday, less painful  in 1968. Life on Prince was full of laughter. I certainly  will miss her. "
"Ahhh, it is with a very sad heart that I write you to say how sorry I am.  Polly was a great light in our family--always making us feel so good with her joy and enthusiasm.  She was very dear to me.  I am so sad for you, and I am grateful she was a happy part of our lives.  
"
I know how hard this is but I know you know that it is also such a blessing.  She is at peace now and the life that had become so hard is now filled with happiness and love in the arms of the Lord!  We are praying for you and your family as you digest this and deal with all that will come from her passing. You know you can ALWAYS call to cry or yell or scream!! Sending you much love!
"tears in my eyes
I wish I were with you to hug you
lots of time for that later
beautifully written :):):)

my ""second mother""
and I love about what you said
Polly had longed to be with Andy
can you see Peggy Bill Andy & Polly now?!?!!!! :)
know you have sooo much on your plate

and I know you will let me help
April is carzy - my fingers are crossed
HUGE HUG!!!  "
"I have so many fond memories of your mother and especially remember how appreciative I was of her when she welcomed me to your home when I was a young 18 year old so far away from home. Also remember the funny times of how she would wake us up to have one of us ""save"" an empty parking place in front of your beautiful home. She was so spunky, thoughtful, smart and beautiful and am certain you will miss her. But, I know you find comfort knowing she will be with your precious dad. Perhaps they can reacquaint themselves with my parents again and they can be our guardian angels--God knows we need watching over. Sending much love to you and your fabulous family. Please let me know when you decide to have the memorial service. Quite frankly, you were on my mind yesterday and I had thought that I would give you a call. That Randy Mac ESP remains. "
"My mother is heartbroken to hear this news.  Your mother was her oldest, longest Alexandria friend and was talking yesterday about wanting to visit her this week. My deepest condolences.

I think back to our childhood days and your mother's energy, good humor and all-around spunkiness as she carpooled us, or organized a craft event to make angels or whatever.  She never talked about her personal challenges, she seemed to always look outward, and to try to make the other person feel welcomed and loved.  Not that she wasn't capable of some wonderful, well-targeted zingers! I know the past year or so brought much suffering to her and to all of your family.  May she rest in God's peace always.
"
"How can this next phase be happening?   How much did I love your mom - the Christmas parties, caroling in Old town, her rushing to the phone out of breath - ""Helllllllloooooo!"" her hugs and kisses, her beauty, her sense of humor, her wit, her grace and flair - everything.   She was a dynamo and loved you all so much and what a blessing to have had her as your wonderful mother.  Our thoughts and prayers are with you and your family now.   Please send my love to everyone and I will wait to hear the plans for a memorial. Thank you so so much for being there for me and rest assured I will be there for you!   "
"I am so saddened to hear about your mom.  As crazy as this sounds, I think of your mom and find a smile on my face-a laugh at her wonderful personality.  She will be missed.  You all have been a role model for how to care for our parents.  Thinking of you and the family.  Many prayers for you and her spirit.  I know she is at peace.  Let me know any details for arrangements.  And, if there is anything Barry and I can do, just call.  "
Wally and I are so sad. We loved your mom so much. We feel fortunate to have had such a nice visit w Polly recently. She looked beautiful and was a wonderful hostess as always. We are in Charlottesville until lunchtime Sunday. Please call me if you need any help or errands done or a place to crash. 
I am so heartbroken to read this news.  Please know I am sending my love to you and yours.  I will try to give you a call in the next few days. 
"Our hearts break !! George and I loved your mother as though she were our own. No other person could light up a room like Polly!  She had intensity, brilliance and dominance!  She was amazing- wicked smart and funny! The world is a little less bright today without her.  We know she has sailed to heaven- and that she has straightened anything out that needed doing :) Bless all of you.  Surely it has been tough these last few years... but rejoice in her good life and in knowing how much she was loved- and by so many. We shall keep you in our prayers.  And please know we will keep dear Polly in our hearts forever.  "
"My heart just skipped a beat when I saw your email.  I have been wanting so to visit Polly and I can’t really picture life without her.   She was so much fun and beloved, especially by Mom & Dad. She was also so supportive yeeaaarrrs ago as I planned to camp across country …….   "
Thank you for letting us know. We are so sorry to hear this. Polly was so dear to us! Love to all of you.
"Vanessa and I were really sorry to hear the news today. I'm very sad that Vanessa didn't get the chance to meet grandma Polly and experience her wit and clever humour first hand, although she has heard stories. She will certainly be missed. She had a good, long life, a beautiful family and many friends. Glad to hear that Gov and Clay were by her side, and that she went peacefully. "
I am just reading this and I am shocked ... and SO sorry that I never got to see Polly after she moved from her house. We are thinking of you and your family and can only imagine how bittersweet this is. 
"We were so sorry to hear about your mom and we all send our love and condolences to you and all of your family.  We know that she will be greatly missed by all who knew and loved her.  She had such a wonderful life and a beautiful, devoted and loving family.  We are so glad to know that she didn't suffer and was able to enjoy her last days with her family. We are currently in Scottsdale for our annual trip to spring training, and Tuesday I'll be heading back to California for a few weeks. Please give our love to all of your family and let us know if there is anything we can do to help during this time. "
"Bob and I are so sorry for your loss and know that you will miss your mother so very much.  She sounds like she was a wonderful woman, whom brought a lot of joy to so many people.  What a blessing to know that she is in the loving arms of our Lord, and, once again with your sweet father.
Please know that Bob and I will be praying for you and your family during this difficult time.  We know that you will always carry such beautiful memories of your mother with you and that will bring you comfort.  And Marney know that your mother is so proud of what a beautiful and caring daughter you were and are.  You are a blessing!!
We love you and if we can do anything at all...we are here.
Love and prayers precious friends,
Bob and Angie
""Now may the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, so that you may abound in hope, through the power of the Holy Spirit."""
"What a wonderful and fierce spirit she was. Though I did not know your mother well, I will always cherish the times I did have with her and the many beautiful stories about her from Richard and his family. "
"I am at a loss of words with the news and as you have said it is a shock to us. 
Like you I have lost both of my parents 
Sent from my iPhone"
"I'm so sorry to read about grandma Polley's passing. You & your family are in my thoughts and prayers during this difficult time. I can't imagine how you must be feeling right now. I'm grateful to read though that her death was a peaceful one, alongside loving family members. I wish you both strength and comfort during this time of mourning & celebration of her beautiful life. I love y'all dearly. "
"Sergio and I are so sad to hear the news about Polly! We will miss her terribly-- she was such a vibrant, loving person, a true Lady. She could always make us laugh so! And she had a great knack for making us feel special and dearly loved. I know these last years have been hard, as they were with Dad. It is bittersweet to say goodbye to these precious parents, who were remarkable people and a cut above. And may I not neglect sending much love to Valerie, who has also lost her mother recently! What a time, as these giants fall. May God have mercy and continue to comfort us in their absence. We were richly blessed in having Polly in our lives. We love you so much."
"I am saddened to hear her of Polly’s passing and yet I know that in the end, the Lord knows best. I will keep you all in my prayers as you deal with your loss and “move forward”. I will remember her for a long long time to come. She was a beautiful, sweet, spunky wonderful lady and she had my heart from day 1! If there’s anything I can do for you all, please don’t hesitate to let me know. May God bless you all."
"I am at a loss of words with the news and as you have said, it is a shock to us. Like you, I have lost both of my parents. And even though we love them so much, we don't want to say goodbye but it gave us some sense of relief when their suffering was over.
As I learned through numerous stories, Grandma Polley was beautiful, sweet, loving, and so special. I have no doubt she is a beautiful angel who is at peace in the presence of our Lord. On behalf of the Giralt family, Ashley, David, and myself we send our most heartfelt condolences"
"My thoughts  and prayers are with you and your family in this difficult time. Mrs. Burke lived life to the fullest and she was lucky to have children like you guys.  I have a chance to be part of the care for so many people but you guys were amazing  care giver to your mom. Specially you, Marney,( the one and only) are a kind daughter  every mother wish to have. Like you said, Mrs. Burke is in a better place with her husband and we should be celebrating her life not her death. May her soul rest in peace."
"	
	
Marney, Marney, Marney....
You have been in my prayers.....
I know that even if we think we are prepared for such things, they are still ""shocking"" and difficult in ways we may not have imagined....My heart goes out to you......

Thank you for sharing all the info -- and George and I hope to be at the Memorial Service on the 29th..

I have 4 people looking right now to verify appointments...there is another one, an historical board in Alexandria...I will get correct title for you asap..
She was also part of my ""First Lady's Advisory Council""....but let me put together a correct list in just a minute...our Secretary of the Commonwealth, Betsy Beamer, will get back to me shortly and I know she will have it all...George was also looking...We all want it to be right! :) 

I walked past  your mom's house yesterday on my way to meet a friend for lunch at Virtue..... I saw the flowers woven in to her iron gate...and thought they were beautiful -- so at a sad moment walking past, I was reminded that there is beauty in knowing a person and knowing that they flourished, like those flowers, at their moment here amongst us...it made walking down Prince St just a tad easier.......

Hang in there sweet friend.... 
Will get back to you shortly...xx"
"It is with great sadness that I heard the news. I'm so very sorry Gov.  My best to your brother and sister. I'll try to be there if I can. For what it is worth, I've had a year, and then some, to ponder my Dad's passing. Time. There is nothing it can't do: It breaks everything and fixes everything."
 I saw on Facebook this morning that your Mom passed away this week. I’m so sorry to hear that. Please pass on my condolences to Governor and Marney. Your Mother was a great lady and always the most gracious. I remember one time in particular when Stewart and I were walking in the snow down Union Street and your Mom saw us and called for us to come visit with her. We hadn’t talked in years but she recognized me even bundled up in snow clothes. Stewart was mightily impressed at how thoughtful and sweet she was to us that day. I know you all will miss her terribly.
"It’s great to see you again.  I know the times are tough now, but she is happy now.  She is where she ought to be.  Looking down on us, making sure we are doing all the right things.  She would like that.  Take care."
"Oh, rats ...well, I haven't been there for you, Marney ...so, so sorry ...my wonderful, fun lady, Polly ...(not sure why the obit is filled with ""fake news"" -- am sure she would have preferred you to list her age as ""somewhere in her mid-40s ..."")

Let me know when you're free to catch up ...I still think of the cocktails at her house (with that pink shirt she had made for your Dad ...with the home number on it ...hilarious!) and her serving the ham rolls in the Silent Butler ...(I have been looking for one ever since then and can't find one like it ...so, so funny ...) - xx"
"I was so sorry to hear about your Mother's death. As I have learned, death can also be a friend. I think this is the case for her. That certainly doesn't mean you won't miss her! It's an odd void but she had a marvelous life. I am happy that you didn't have to move her to Dallas. You were an amazing daughter with an equally amazing and generous husband. Her illness must have been difficult being so far away. You have my thoughts and prayers."
"It is with a heavy heart that I must tell you I cannot be with you on the 29 th of April.  I am torn, but I really have no choice.  I made plans months ago to spend the weekend in Hot Springs with Mike Millner's wife Jill and Chris Millner's wife Toni.  They are flying here to drive there with me Friday and flying home Sunday.  If I could change the plan , I would.  Oh dear, I just can't. You are wonderful- each of you.  Your joint letter was lovely; and I know the celebration will be too.  I love thinking about Polly and Andy being together again; and I can't help but smile broadly when I picture her excitedly greeting  not only your dad, but also all the other great people in our family who preceded her... mom and dad and David too!"
"Carmela and I were saddened to hear of the passing of your step-mom, such a beautiful and accomplished woman, and obviously beloved by her children and extended family. . On our behalf, as well as that of my parents, please know that our thoughts are with you at this time. We offer our sincere condolences."
"Oh, so sorry Gov.!  Your Mom was quite the woman!  Happy to have visited with her previously.  She packed a lot into those years. Even though it was probably expected, it is still hard to lose someone that important to you, especially since you lost your Dad so young.  Sending you an extra big hug!  Wish I could do it in person. Please express our sympathy to your whole family.  Give ""Jules"" and Marnie a hug too.  Keeping y'all in our prayers! "
"Dear Marney, I would like to have written a proper note, but, as I don't have an address, this will have to do.
The sad news of Polly's passing brought back so many fond memories of fun times with Polly and ""her crowd,"" back in the day.  I had taken the secretarial school track instead of college, so was happily thrown into this older crowd, and their social scene.  It was also fun running into my ""uncle"" Andy, in whose wedding I had been the flower girl. I adored him and who could not have adored Polly? Thank you for including me in the memorial service and reception.  I would so love to be there, but it isn't possible. It would indeed be a sentimental journey, having lived at #117 and my grandmother Beatie, next to where you grew up. My deep sympathy and affection I send to you and all the family.  Included is an invitation to come to Cape Cod, if you are ever up this way."
"My thoughts and prayers are with all of you. The loss of a parent is devastating. Your mother had that rare gift of making everyone feel she was so delighted to see them. I remember well, her contagious smile and her lovely gracious manner. Was able to write Ruth, Michael and Tony, as I had their addresses. You will not remember me, as it's been almost 50 years since I saw you, but I wanted you to know I was thinking of you as well. I have the fortunate opportunity to see Ruth and Michael on occasion. Hope to see each of you when you are in New Orleans. Take care."
"I was so sorry to hear about your mother (just saw your email which went to an old address) but I totally understand the peace you felt for her. And it sounds like your mother's exit was classic! There is certainly an odd emptiness when your mother dies. Sort of inexplicable, but that hole in your heart will heal with time. I hope you and Ruthie have fun at WC, I love that resort. Please keep me posted on the plans for your mother's service. Your mom was bigger than life and someone who always put a smile on my face!  And the best thing was her sense of humor which she most certainly passed onto you."
"As luck would have it, I have been assigned to do the readings at Mass on the day of your mother's Memorial Service, so I can offer the Mass for Polly.   That makes me so happy! Have a prayerful Holy Week and a very Happy Easter.      "
"I've just returned from Hong Kong, visiting the grandkids, and have been thinking a lot about your wonderful mother. While I obviously haven't seen her probably more than once or twice over the last 30 years or more, my memories of her are strong and clear. I so loved and respected her. What spirit, what spunk, what a smile. She lit a room up and lightened the air the minute she walked into a room. My heart goes out to you, Julian, Guv, Michael and Tony. From what Martha has told me, her last few years haven't been easy but that doesn't mitigate the pain of losing your mom. I will say I have this wonderful picture of a very merry Burke-Dawes reunion going on in heaven right now, full of laughter, singing and great story telling .. some true and some stretching the truth a little but that only adding to the drama and excitement. Even now I miss sitting on the sidelines and listening to your mom and dad, your grandmother (Alice), my grandparents and my mother, and your aunts and uncles all regaling each other with stories .. laughing hysterically the whole time. I do so hope to be with you next month on the 29th.  Martha and I are trying to come down together. In the meantime, know my thoughts and prayers are with you all and Tim and I are sending much love. "
"Thank you so much for your email and for the information about your mom's memorial service.  The obituary was lovely and the photo of your mom was beautiful!  I loved her earrings! You were such a wonderful daughter-- I know that you, and everyone who knew and loved her, are going to miss her very much.  I'll always remember what a special person your mom was-- so gracious, thoughtful, kind and friendly.  We send our condolences to all of your family and are keeping your mom, and all of you, in our thoughts and prayers.  "
"Oh Marney . . . . we are SO SORRY for your loss.  We just ADORED your mom, and she SO ADORED her children and grandchildren.  We know this is VERY HARD, as your mom was VERY SPECIAL -- one of a kind.  When you think of your mom -- and you all have been in our thoughts for days -- we think of deeply insightful of all people and issues, always very interesting and well read, always wonderful to be around, a political dynamo who knew how to get people elected, empathetic of others --- and --- most importantly -- just (as she would whisper when others could not hear) -- ""damn"" fun!!!!  We know how much you all miss her -- we do too.
Thank you so much for the invitation to the Service.  As you mom would say, ""would not miss it for the world."""
I am so very sorry for your loss.  Our thoughts and prayers are with you and your wonderful family.
"Thank you Marney for your call, so sorry, big loss for all of us.  We'll always miss her, she has been a beacon of light in many peoples' lives.  She will for forever be alive in our memory. My son Adam, his wife Jennifer and I extend our deepest sympathy. We were lucky to visit with her during the summer (Governor with her) before she moved, she met Jennifer before and was so excited to know that they're getting married.  We were lucky to spend half-hour of fun with her. Great spirit. She has a special place in our hearts.  With love and prayers."
"I am so sorry about your Mother.  I never had the pleasure of knowing her, but I know she must have been a wonderful woman to have raise such a beautiful and kind daughter.  Tom and I send our prayers and thoughts to you and your lovely family."
"Honestly, Gail, she was just like you❣️ Beautiful (inside and out,) loving, kind, smart, wonderful humor, self deprecating, generous of heart, a total ""doer,"" never a complainer, always welcoming, a champion to all, and, of course, never looked her age❣️ I know I have always been drawn to you because you remind me so much of younger version of Mom❣️ Thank you and Tom for always being so dear to me...all of us❣️xo, M"
I'm in Chile right now and your email is the first I hear about your mom's passing. I am so sorry. I know you were very close to her but I also know you spent us much time as you could with her. She had a long and blessed life and I am sure you will have plenty of wonderful memories to remember her always. 
"I am so sorry to hear about your mom. I will always remember her as a beautiful woman inside and out. Like my mom said obviously she was wonderful because she raised you and your brothers. We love you and if there is anything we can do to help you, please do not hesitate to ask. You are all in our thoughts and prayers."
"Oh Marney . . . . we are SO SORRY for your loss.  We just ADORED your mom, and she SO ADORED her children and grandchildren.  We know this is VERY HARD, as your mom was VERY SPECIAL -- one of a kind.

I sooooo remember ""Warshington"" pronunciation
thank you thank you for making the effort to share
grt big hug
:) me"
And I'm so glad Phillip menioned the egg salad sandwiches!
"I read both of the celebration of life letters about your mom and the thing that struck me the most was the part that read........ ""She had the magical ability to reach out easily and make people feel very special"".  That she did to ALL of us and we are so blessed to have such wonderful memories of her.  Every time I think of Ms. Polly, I smile."
Jan shared this with several of us.......How beautiful were these memories!!! I am so glad that you will be here over the holidays........Polly will be here in spirit (and probably in room 523)...ha!!
"Get out the kleenex kids...............
These are from Polly's church celebration day.  Just WOW!"
"You owe me Kleenex!!!!!
But thank you so much for including me with this.  What wonderful words from them both.
She really was quite something!

I passed the reservations information on to Kelly so she can start the process.  Just keep us in the loop as time marches on.  Summer is here and it's hot and buggy.  We've been have extensive street work done RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE HOTEL FOR DAYS, but at last it's quiet and not too much more to do.  At least the street isn't closed any more!
The hotel is pretty quiet now for about another week....just weddings and proms on the weekends now.

This mother's day will be a tough one for you all....but like I told Julian, she's with you, she's there. Thanks again for including me and I've shared with Karen and Kathy and Kelly as well.  I appreciate it so much. What great emotional and respectful writings."
"As usual, you are so sweet and thoughtful, Marney, to send me both the pastor's beautiful homily for your mother and also young Philip's admirable and eloquent eulogy.   After reading both, I was almost speechless and I certainly was not dry-eyed.   And I realized that I was not the only one who loved Polly . . . there were hundreds, if not thousands, like me.  Every time I re-read them, I still choke up.   What magnificent and well-deserved tributes!   Thank you for making me feel a part of that special day!
My love and thanks to both you and Philip and to any young ones on your doorstep.           Janet"
"I am so very sad to hear of the death of your wonderful mother, dear Polly, whom I have loved from the first time I met her.   But, as Julian said, it is uplifting to think of her reunited with your father amid the joys of heaven.
 
I'm sure you are now wending your way to Alexandria for a private family farewell and funeral.  So do not even think of answering this email.  I am on my way to Mass in an hour, so I am happy to be able to offer the Mass for Polly and I know I shall be thinking of her throughout it. My thoughts are with you and your brothers also in this time of sorrow and unity. Much love and many hugs . . .  "
"
Yesterday's service was so perfect, Marney.  I laughed, I cried and then sobbed at the end of Oran's homily which was SO incredibly sweet and true--I felt it all, and I hope you all can feel so proud in the outpouring of beloved friends and family who turned out yesterday to celebrate your precious momma.  It was incredibly amazing walking out of our front door yesterday.  Other neighbor's started to emerge at the same time.  Then we joined more along the 200 block of Prince, others on the 300 block...it was like a parade.  It was powerful to start off as a family and then arrive at St. Paul's as a collective group who all just loved Polly and your family.  Your son's remembrance was perfectly delivered and poignant.  Joe really liked the m&m's story.  :). I am sure you are worn out today, but I hope you feel great about it all.  Safe travels back to TX.  "
"I carried my beloved cherub over to our new house yesterday and gave her a little tour of our courtyard.  I think she likes it!  I placed her along the wall outside my kitchen window, so I can see my guardian angel every day."
